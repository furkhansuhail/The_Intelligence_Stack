Random Forests — Wisdom of a Crowd of Trees
============================================

A single decision tree is fast, interpretable, and non-linear — but it suffers
from one crippling weakness: high variance. Small changes in training data produce
dramatically different trees. Random Forests solve this by training hundreds of
trees on randomised subsets of the data and features, then aggregating their
predictions. The result is a model that is more accurate, far more stable, and
surprisingly robust — all without a single hyperparameter that requires deep
domain knowledge to tune.

Random Forests are one of the most widely deployed machine learning algorithms
in industry. They require minimal preprocessing, handle mixed feature types, give
reliable out-of-the-box performance, and produce built-in estimates of their own
generalisation error.

### What is a Random Forest?

A Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees where each tree is trained on
a different randomised view of the data. Predictions are made by aggregating
the votes (classification) or averaging the outputs (regression) of all trees.

The key insight comes from statistics: the average of many noisy-but-unbiased
estimators is less noisy than any single estimator. If we could train many trees
that each made independent errors, the errors would cancel out on averaging. The
challenge is that trees trained on the same data are not independent — they make
correlated errors. Random Forests break this correlation through two sources of
randomness:

    1. Bootstrap sampling     — each tree sees a different random subset of rows
    2. Feature subsampling    — each split considers only a random subset of columns

Together, these make each tree different enough that their errors partially cancel,
producing an ensemble that is dramatically more stable and accurate than any single
tree — without adding bias.

Think of it like polling. Asking one expert gives you a noisy estimate. Asking 500
independent experts and averaging their answers gives a much more reliable estimate.
The key word is independent — if all experts read the same newspaper, they'll make
the same errors and the average won't help. Random Forests are a way of engineering
independence between trees trained on the same dataset.

    Things that exist inside the model (learned during training):
        - The full set of decision trees (each with its own structure and splits)
        - OOB (out-of-bag) error estimate — a free validation metric

    Things you control before training (hyperparameters):
        - n_estimators           — number of trees (more = better, diminishing returns)
        - max_features           — features considered per split (key randomness knob)
        - max_depth              — depth limit per tree (None = grow fully)
        - min_samples_leaf       — minimum examples per leaf
        - bootstrap              — whether to use bootstrap sampling (default True)


### Random Forests as Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM)

Random Forests extend the decision tree ERM formulation with an ensemble layer:

    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

There is no gradient descent, no loss function being minimised jointly across trees.
Each tree is trained independently. The "learning" happens through the averaging
operation: the ensemble's bias matches a single tree's bias, but its variance is
reduced by a factor of roughly B (number of trees).


### The Inductive Bias of Random Forests

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  Random Forests inherit the decision tree inductive bias:   │
    │    - Axis-aligned splits (no linearity assumption)          │
    │    - Piecewise-constant output per region                   │
    │    - Non-parametric (can approximate any function)          │
    │                                                             │
    │  And add two ensemble beliefs:                              │
    │    - DIVERSITY is valuable — trees that disagree and are    │
    │      both partially right produce better aggregates         │
    │    - LOCAL MAJORITY — the prediction for any input should   │
    │      be determined by the consensus of trees that each      │
    │      "saw" that region of feature space differently         │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The inductive bias is weaker than a single tree because the ensemble can express
more complex boundaries (each tree votes on boundary regions differently). But the
features still must be relevant through axis-aligned comparisons.

### Part 1: Bagging — Bootstrap Aggregating


### The Variance Problem:

From the decision tree module, we know that a single tree has high variance. Formally,
if a learning algorithm A has prediction variance σ² at any test point, and we train B
independent models and average them, the variance of the average is:

                        Var(ŷ_avg) = σ² / B

The variance shrinks by the number of models. With B=100 trees, variance shrinks
100-fold — in principle. The catch: the trees must be independent.

If all trees are identical (trained on the same data, same algorithm), averaging
does nothing: Var(ŷ_avg) = σ² (no improvement). We need diversity.


### Bootstrap Sampling:

For each tree b out of B:
    1. Draw n samples FROM THE TRAINING SET WITH REPLACEMENT (bootstrap sample)
    2. Train a full decision tree on this bootstrap sample

Each bootstrap sample contains approximately 63.2% unique training examples
(some are duplicated, some are absent). The remaining ~36.8% are the "out-of-bag"
(OOB) examples — training points not seen by tree b.

**Why 63.2%? The Poisson Approximation:**

The probability that a specific example is NOT selected in any of n draws is:
    (1 − 1/n)^n  → e^(-1) ≈ 0.368  as n → ∞

So each bootstrap sample includes ~63.2% of unique examples, leaving ~36.8% OOB.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 1 — Bootstrap Sampling for 3 Trees:**

    FULL TRAINING SET (n=10 examples):  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    Tree 1 bootstrap: [2, 2, 4, 7, 7, 1, 9, 3, 5, 6]  ← 8 unique, 2 duplicated
    Tree 1 OOB:       [8, 10]                           ← never seen by Tree 1

    Tree 2 bootstrap: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9, 2, 4, 10, 5] ← 9 unique, 1 duplicated
    Tree 2 OOB:       [7]

    Tree 3 bootstrap: [5, 6, 6, 2, 9, 1, 4, 3, 8, 10] ← 8 unique, 2 duplicated
    Tree 3 OOB:       [7, 11]... wait, only 10 examples, some just unused

    Each tree sees a slightly different training distribution.
    The differences in data → trees make different errors → errors partially cancel.

    PREDICTION (new example x):
        Tree 1 predicts: Class A
        Tree 2 predicts: Class A
        Tree 3 predicts: Class B
        Final: majority vote → Class A  (2/3 trees agree)
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimate:

The OOB examples for tree b are examples the tree never trained on — they function
as a validation set. For each training example i, we can get a prediction from
all trees for which example i was OOB. Aggregating these OOB predictions gives
an estimate of generalisation error without ever holding out a separate validation set.

    OOB prediction for example i = majority vote of {T_b(xᵢ) : i ∈ OOB_b}
    OOB error = fraction of training examples where OOB prediction ≠ true label

**This is remarkable:** a free, unbiased estimate of generalisation error is obtained
as a byproduct of the training process. No cross-validation needed.

The OOB error estimate is nearly identical to k-fold cross-validation with k ≈ 1/0.368 ≈ 3
folds, but costs nothing extra because the OOB sets are created automatically during training.

### Part 2: Feature Subsampling — Creating Tree Diversity


### The Correlation Problem with Pure Bagging:

If we only use bootstrap sampling (without feature randomness), all trees will tend
to split on the same few highly predictive features at their roots. This makes the
trees correlated — they make similar errors, and averaging correlated errors gives
less reduction in variance than averaging independent errors.

Consider a dataset where Feature A is very predictive and features B–Z are less so.
Every bootstrap-sampled tree will use Feature A at or near the root. Despite being
different trees, they all heavily rely on Feature A in the same way. Their predictions
are strongly correlated, and the variance reduction from averaging is small.


### Random Feature Subsets at Each Split:

At each split, instead of searching all p features for the best threshold, Random
Forests randomly select m < p features and only consider those as candidates:

    Classification:  m = sqrt(p)   (sklearn default)
    Regression:      m = p/3       (sklearn default)

This means even if Feature A is the globally best feature, it won't be considered
at every split of every tree — sometimes other features get their chance. This
forces the trees to use different features, decorrelating their predictions.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 2 — Feature Subsampling: Decorrelating Trees:**

    DATASET: p=6 features  [A, B, C, D, E, F]
    Feature A is the most predictive.  m = sqrt(6) ≈ 2 features per split.

    Tree 1, root split:  candidates [A, D]  → best is A  → split on A
    Tree 2, root split:  candidates [B, E]  → best is B  → split on B  ← DIFFERENT!
    Tree 3, root split:  candidates [A, C]  → best is A  → split on A
    Tree 4, root split:  candidates [D, F]  → best is D  → split on D  ← DIFFERENT!

    Without feature subsampling (bagging only):
        All 4 trees would pick A at the root (it's always the best).
        Trees are correlated → averaging reduces variance by < 4x.

    With feature subsampling:
        Trees pick different features → less correlated.
        Averaging reduces variance much closer to 4x.

    EFFECT:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    m = p (no feature randomness):   trees correlated, small variance gain
    m = sqrt(p):                     trees decorrelated, large variance gain
    m = 1:                           maximum diversity, high bias per tree
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Bias-Variance Decomposition of Ensembles:

Let ρ = correlation between predictions of any two trees. Then for B trees:

            Var(ensemble) = ρ · σ² + (1 − ρ) · σ²/B

Where σ² is the variance of a single tree. Two components:
    - ρ · σ²:         irreducible component — adding more trees doesn't help here
    - (1 − ρ) · σ²/B: reducible component — shrinks as B grows

As B → ∞:   Var → ρ · σ²   (a lower bound — can't go below this)

**To minimise ensemble variance, we need both:**
    1. Small ρ (low correlation between trees) — achieved by feature subsampling
    2. Large B (many trees) — but diminishing returns after some point

Feature subsampling directly reduces ρ. Without it, ρ is close to 1 and the
lower bound ρ·σ² ≈ σ² — no improvement over a single tree.


---


### Part 3: The Aggregation Step


### Classification — Majority Voting:

For a new example x, each of the B trees outputs a class label prediction.
The forest predicts the class with the most votes:

            ŷ = argmax_c  Σ_b  1[T_b(x) = c]

Soft voting (probability averaging) is often better: average the per-class
probabilities from each tree, then predict the class with the highest mean probability.

    Hard voting:    each tree votes once, majority wins
    Soft voting:    each tree outputs [P(c=0), P(c=1), ...], average probabilities

Soft voting is preferred because it takes into account the confidence of each tree,
not just its top prediction.


### Regression — Mean Averaging:

For regression, each tree outputs a continuous value. The forest averages:

                    ŷ = (1/B) Σ_b  T_b(x)

This is equivalent to the mean of the piecewise-constant functions from each tree.
The ensemble produces a smoother approximation of the true function than any single tree.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 3 — How Averaging Smooths the Regression:**

    TRUE FUNCTION: y = sin(x)   (smooth curve)

    SINGLE TREE:              RANDOM FOREST (B=100 trees):

    y ↑                        y ↑
      │    ┌──┐  ┌──┐            │     /‾‾\
      │    │  │  │  │            │    /    \
      │────┘  └──┘  └────        │   /      \
      │                          │  /        \u005f___
      │staircase (step fn)        │ smooth curve
      └──────────────→ x          └──────────────→ x

    Each tree is a staircase. 100 different staircases, slightly offset
    from each other due to bootstrap randomness, average into a smooth curve.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Convergence with Number of Trees:

Adding more trees always reduces variance (or keeps it the same). The test error
of a Random Forest converges as B → ∞ — it never increases with more trees.

This is unlike other hyperparameters (max_depth, C) where there is a sweet spot.
For n_estimators, more is always better, but with strongly diminishing returns.
Common practice: use 100–500 trees; rarely need more than 1000.

    B = 10:   high variance — ensemble still heavily influenced by individual trees
    B = 100:  good — most of the variance reduction achieved
    B = 500:  very stable — error has converged
    B = 5000: marginal improvement — 10× the compute for <1% gain


---


### Part 4: Out-of-Bag Error — Free Validation


### Using OOB Predictions:

For each training example xᵢ, we collect predictions only from the trees in whose
bootstrap sample xᵢ was absent (OOB trees for xᵢ):

    OOB prediction for xᵢ = majority_vote  or  mean  of {T_b(xᵢ) : i ∉ bootstrap_b}

On average, each example has approximately B × 0.368 ≈ 37% of B trees available
as OOB predictors. For B=100, that is ~37 trees per example.

OOB error = fraction of training examples incorrectly predicted by their OOB ensemble.


### OOB Error vs Cross-Validation:

### Part 5: Feature Importance in Random Forests


### Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI):

Exactly as in single trees, but averaged across all B trees:

    MDI(feature f) = (1/B) Σ_b  Σ_{nodes in T_b where f is used}  (n_node/n) × gain

Features used consistently across many trees and at high-impact nodes receive
large MDI scores. Features that rarely appear or only in deep, low-impact nodes
receive small scores.

**Inherited caveat:** MDI is biased toward high-cardinality features. A feature
with 100 unique values has more thresholds to consider than a binary feature, so
it's more likely to produce a high-gain split by chance.


### Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) / Permutation Importance:

For each tree b and each feature f:
    1. Compute prediction accuracy on the OOB examples of tree b
    2. Randomly permute the values of feature f in the OOB examples
    3. Recompute OOB accuracy
    4. The difference is tree b's importance estimate for feature f

Average across all B trees:

    MDA(feature f) = mean over trees of  [Acc_OOB(b) − Acc_OOB_permuted(b, f)]

MDA is more reliable than MDI because:
    - It measures actual predictive contribution, not a proxy (impurity)
    - It's evaluated on OOB examples (unseen data), not training data
    - It is not biased toward high-cardinality features


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — MDI vs MDA/Permutation Importance:**

    MDI: measured during training (impurity reduction in the tree)
    MDA: measured after training (performance drop from feature shuffling)

    Example: A feature correlated with the label by chance in training data

    MDI  →  HIGH (it reduces training impurity, even if it's noise)
    MDA  →  LOW  (shuffling it doesn't hurt OOB accuracy — it IS noise)

    MDI can be fooled by noise features with many unique values.
    MDA catches this because OOB examples reveal the true predictive signal.
    Always compare both — large MDI + small MDA = suspicious (likely noise).
    # =======================================================================================#

### Part 6: Extremely Randomised Trees (Extra-Trees)


### One Step Further in Randomness:

Extra-Trees (sklearn's `ExtraTreesClassifier`) push randomisation one step further:
at each split, instead of finding the best threshold for each candidate feature,
they draw a RANDOM threshold for each feature and pick the best among random splits.

    Random Forest:      random features + best threshold per feature
    Extra-Trees:        random features + random threshold per feature

This makes individual trees even weaker learners — more biased, higher training
error per tree. But it also makes the trees more decorrelated (lower ρ), which
means averaging gives even larger variance reduction.

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                Random Forest     Extra-Trees       │
    │────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────│
    │  Threshold search     Best per feature    Random per feature       │
    │  Per-tree bias        Moderate            Higher                   │
    │  Per-tree variance    Moderate            Lower                    │
    │  Tree correlation ρ   Moderate            Lower                    │
    │  Training speed       Slower (search)     Faster (no search)       │
    │  Ensemble bias        ≈ same as RF        Slightly higher          │
    │  Ensemble variance    Moderate            Lower                    │
    │  Typical accuracy     Slightly better     Slightly worse or equal  │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

In practice, Random Forest and Extra-Trees often perform similarly. Extra-Trees
train significantly faster and can win when the dataset is very noisy.

**Random Forests excel when:**
    - Tabular data with mixed feature types
    - You need good performance with minimal preprocessing
    - Interpretability is secondary to accuracy
    - Dataset is medium-sized (n = 1k–1M)
    - You want reliable uncertainty estimates (OOB, prediction variance)

**Random Forests struggle when:**
    - You need a human-readable model (use a single tree)
    - Data has strong temporal structure (use sequence models)
    - Extrapolation is required (all tree-based models fail here)
    - Extremely high-dimensional sparse data (n << p, use LR or SVM)
    - Very large n (> 10M): gradient boosting or neural networks scale better


### The Bridge to Gradient Boosting:

Random Forests reduce variance by averaging. But what if we want to reduce bias too?
Gradient Boosted Trees (the next module) do this by training trees sequentially,
each one fitting the residual errors of the previous ensemble:

    Random Forest:          B trees in PARALLEL, each independent
                            → reduces variance, bias unchanged

    Gradient Boosting:      B trees SEQUENTIALLY, each corrects previous errors
                            → reduces bias AND variance, but more hyperparameters

    The full progression from this module:

    Single Tree     →   high variance, interpretable
    Random Forest   →   low variance (averaging), less interpretable
    Gradient Boost  →   low bias + low variance (boosting), least interpretable,
                        but typically highest accuracy on tabular data

RANDOM FOREST FROM SCRATCH

We build a Random Forest on top of the DecisionTreeClassifier from Module 04.
This illustrates the exact mechanism without any sklearn magic:

    1. Bootstrap sample the training data (with replacement)
    2. For each split, randomly restrict which features can be considered
    3. Train a full decision tree on the bootstrap sample
    4. Repeat B times, storing all trees
    5. Predict by majority vote

We also compute the OOB error manually.

  An important theoretical result:

    Bias(RF) = Bias(single tree)

  Averaging does not reduce bias. If each tree is underfitting, the average
  of underfitting trees is still underfitting.

  This means: make each tree a LOW BIAS learner (grow deep, don't prune much).
  Then average to reduce the high variance that deep trees produce.

  Contrast with boosting: each tree in a boosted ensemble is a HIGH BIAS
  learner (shallow, max_depth=1–3). Boosting reduces bias sequentially.

  1.  Bootstrap + feature subsampling → diverse, decorrelated trees
  2.  Averaging B trees: Var(ensemble) = ρ·σ² + (1-ρ)·σ²/B
  3.  Bias of ensemble = bias of single tree (averaging doesn't reduce bias)
  4.  OOB error ≈ 3-fold CV accuracy — a free generalisation estimate
  5.  MDI importance is fast but biased toward high-cardinality features
  6.  Permutation importance is slower but unbiased and more reliable
  7.  More trees always helps (or is neutral) — no overfitting with n_estimators
  8.  Feature subsampling (max_features) is the key hyperparameter — use sqrt(p)
  9.  Extra-Trees: more random thresholds → faster training, similar accuracy
  10. All tree methods fail at extrapolation — plateau at training target range
  11. Next step: Gradient Boosting trains trees sequentially to reduce bias too
