Module 02 · Logistic Regression — Linear Classification via Probability
============================================================

Logistic Regression is the natural evolution of linear regression when the output
is a category rather than a continuous value. It answers the question: given what
I know about this input, what is the probability it belongs to class 1?

Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm. The word
"regression" refers to the underlying linear model — it regresses a linear
combination of inputs, then squashes the result into a probability with the sigmoid.

### What is Logistic Regression?

Despite the name, Logistic Regression is a **classification** algorithm. 
It models the probability that an input belongs to a class by squashing a linear function through the
**sigmoid** (logistic) function.

Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm that models the probability
that an input x belongs to class 1. It takes the exact same linear combination you
saw in linear regression — w·x + b — and passes it through the sigmoid function to
compress the output into the range (0, 1), where it can be interpreted as a probability.

The name is slightly misleading: this is a classification algorithm, not a regression
algorithm. The "regression" refers to the internal linear model. The classification
decision comes from thresholding the output probability.

Think of it like a doctor making a diagnosis. They look at many features — age, blood
pressure, test results — weight each one by its importance (the weights), combine them
into a single risk score (the linear combination z), and then convert that score into
a probability of disease (the sigmoid). If the probability exceeds 50%, the diagnosis
is positive.

    Things that exist inside the model (learnable parameters):
        - Weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₚ)  — importance of each feature for classification
        - Bias (w₀)                   — baseline log-odds of class 1

    Things that exist only at setup time (hyperparameters / configuration):
        - Learning rate (α)           — controls gradient descent step size
        - Regularisation strength (C or λ) — controls overfitting penalty
        - Decision threshold          — probability cutoff for class 1 (default 0.5)
        - Solver                      — optimisation algorithm (lbfgs, sgd, newton, etc.)

### Logistic Regression as Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM)

Just as with linear regression, we can precisely state what logistic regression *is*
within the ERM framework:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  Hypothesis class:  H = { f(x) = σ(w·x + b) | w ∈ ℝᵖ }      │

    │                                                             │

    │                                                             │
    │  Optimiser:  Gradient Descent (no closed-form solution)     │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Compared to linear regression (which uses the same hypothesis class structure but
different output and loss), the two changes are: (1) the prediction is squashed
through sigmoid to produce a probability, and (2) the loss is cross-entropy instead
of MSE. Everything else — the linear model, gradient descent, regularisation — is
structurally identical.

This is the ERM template in action: same framework, different modelling choices.


### The Inductive Bias of Logistic Regression

Every model encodes beliefs about the world before seeing data. For logistic regression:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  Logistic regression assumes:                               │
    │                                                             │
    │  1. LINEAR SEPARABILITY (soft) — the two classes can be     │
    │     approximately separated by a straight hyperplane in     │
    │     feature space (the decision boundary is always linear)  │
    │                                                             │
    │  2. ADDITIVITY — each feature contributes independently     │
    │     to the log-odds of class membership                     │
    │                                                             │
    │  3. LOG-ODDS LINEARITY — the log-odds ln(P/(1-P)) is a      │
    │     linear function of the features (this is what the       │
    │     model actually fits, not the probabilities directly)    │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

When these beliefs are approximately true, logistic regression is fast, interpretable,
and generalises well. When the true decision boundary is curved or non-linear, you need
feature engineering (adding polynomial terms), kernels, or neural networks.

### Part 1 . The Sigmoid Function - The Core Components 

### The Sigmoid Function:

The sigmoid function (also called the logistic function) is the heart of the model:

            σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))     where z = wᵀx

Where z = w·x + b is the linear combination of inputs and weights (the same z you
computed in linear regression). The sigmoid maps any real number z to the interval (0, 1).

Key properties of σ(z):
    - σ(0) = 0.5        → when z = 0, the model is maximally uncertain
    - σ(z) → 1 as z → +∞ → large positive z = confident class 1 prediction
    - σ(z) → 0 as z → -∞ → large negative z = confident class 0 prediction
    - σ(-z) = 1 - σ(z)  → symmetric around z = 0

The derivative has a beautiful closed form:

                    σ'(z) = σ(z) · (1 − σ(z))

This is crucial for backpropagation in neural networks — the derivative of sigmoid
is expressible entirely in terms of the sigmoid output itself, making it cheap to
compute.

    # ======================================================================================= # 

- Output is always in `(0, 1)` — interpretable as a probability
- Decision boundary: predict class 1 if `σ(z) ≥ 0.5`, i.e. if `z ≥ 0`

                    z = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₚxₚ       (linear combination)

                    ŷ = σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e⁻ᶻ)                 (probability of class 1)

                    class = 1  if ŷ ≥ 0.5  (equivalently, if z ≥ 0)
                    class = 0  if ŷ < 0.5  (equivalently, if z < 0)

### Why Not Use Linear Regression for Classification?

A natural question: why not just use linear regression and threshold at 0.5?

There are three reasons this fails:

1. **Unbounded outputs**: Linear regression predicts any real number. Predictions of
   1.7 or -0.3 have no probabilistic interpretation and make the threshold arbitrary.

2. **Wrong loss function**: MSE treats being wrong by 0.1 the same whether you're at
   0.4 (near the boundary) or 0.99 (very confident and very wrong). For classification,
   a confident wrong prediction should be penalised far more than an uncertain one.

3. **Non-convex loss**: If you minimise MSE with a step function output (to get 0/1
   predictions), the loss surface has discontinuities and no gradient. Gradient descent
   can't work. The sigmoid fixes this by making the output smooth.

---

### Part 2: The Loss Function — Binary Cross-Entropy

## Why Not MSE?

MSE doesn't work here (non-convex for probabilities). Instead we use:

L = -(1/n) Σ [ yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 - yᵢ) log(1 - ŷᵢ) ]

This is **log loss** — it heavily penalises confident wrong predictions.

In the previous module, we justified MSE through MLE: minimising MSE is equivalent to
maximising likelihood under Gaussian noise. The same reasoning tells us which loss to
use for classification — we just need the right noise model.

For binary classification, the output y is not a continuous number with Gaussian noise.
It's a coin flip: y ∈ {0, 1}. The correct probabilistic model is Bernoulli.

**The Probabilistic Interpretation:**

Assume the data is generated by:

            P(y = 1 | x; w) = σ(w·x + b) = ŷ

That is: given input x and weights w, the probability of observing class 1 is ŷ.
Equivalently:

            P(y = 0 | x; w) = 1 − ŷ

For a single training example, the likelihood of observing label yᵢ is:

            P(yᵢ | xᵢ; w) = ŷᵢʸⁱ · (1 − ŷᵢ)¹⁻ʸⁱ

This compact formula handles both cases:
    if yᵢ = 1:   P = ŷᵢ¹ · (1 − ŷᵢ)⁰ = ŷᵢ        ← probability of class 1
    if yᵢ = 0:   P = ŷᵢ⁰ · (1 − ŷᵢ)¹ = 1 − ŷᵢ    ← probability of class 0

Taking the log-likelihood over all n training examples:

    log L = Σᵢ [ yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 − yᵢ) log(1 − ŷᵢ) ]

Maximising log-likelihood is the same as minimising the negative log-likelihood,
which is binary cross-entropy:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  BCE = -(1/n) Σᵢ [ yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1−yᵢ) log(1−ŷᵢ) ]          │
    │                                                             │
    │  Logistic Regression + BCE                                  │
    │      = Maximum Likelihood Estimation                        │
    │           under the Bernoulli distribution                  │
    │                                                             │
    │  Compare: Linear Regression + MSE = MLE under Gaussian      │
    │           Logistic Regression + BCE = MLE under Bernoulli   │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The distribution assumption determines the loss function. This pattern generalises
to every regression and classification model in machine learning.


### Unpacking the Cross-Entropy Loss:

    BCE = -(1/n) Σᵢ [ yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1−yᵢ) log(1−ŷᵢ) ]

For any single example, only one of the two terms is active:

    When yᵢ = 1:   loss = -log(ŷᵢ)
    When yᵢ = 0:   loss = -log(1 − ŷᵢ)

The −log function is the key. It is zero when its argument is 1 (confident and correct)
and grows to infinity as its argument approaches 0 (confident and wrong).

    ŷ = 0.05  (confident, WRONG)     → loss =  2.996 ← severe penalty
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

    MSE would give:  ŷ = 0.95 → loss = 0.0025
                     ŷ = 0.05 → loss = 0.9025
    Much smaller penalty for confident wrong predictions.
    Cross-entropy screams loud when you're confidently wrong. MSE barely notices.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Why Is Cross-Entropy Convex? (And Why MSE Is Not):

When using sigmoid output, MSE creates a non-convex loss surface — gradient descent
can get stuck in local minima and never find the global optimum. Cross-entropy with
sigmoid output is provably convex: there is exactly one global minimum, and gradient
descent is guaranteed to find it.

This is not a coincidence. It follows directly from the MLE perspective: cross-entropy
is the canonical loss for Bernoulli outputs, and MLE with Bernoulli gives a log-concave
likelihood — which means a convex negative log-likelihood.

---

### Part 3: Training — Gradient Descent

The gradient of log loss w.r.t. weights is elegantly simple:

∇L = (1/n) Xᵀ (ŷ - y)
w  := w - α ∇L

Same form as linear regression — only the prediction `ŷ = σ(Xw)` differs.


### The Gradient of Binary Cross-Entropy:

Despite the intimidating formula for BCE, its gradient with respect to the weights
is elegantly simple:

                        ∇L = (1/n) Xᵀ(ŷ − y)

This is almost identical to the gradient we derived for MSE in linear regression:

    Linear Regression:    ∇L = (2/n) Xᵀ(Xw − y)     where ŷ = Xw
    Logistic Regression:  ∇L = (1/n) Xᵀ(ŷ − y)       where ŷ = σ(Xw)

The only differences are the constant (2/n vs 1/n, absorbed into α anyway) and the
fact that ŷ is now a sigmoid of the linear combination rather than the linear
combination itself. The update rule is otherwise structurally identical.


**Derivation Sketch (Why the Gradient is So Clean):**

The chain rule on the BCE + sigmoid combination produces a miraculous cancellation.

Step 1 — derivative of BCE with respect to ŷ:
    ∂L/∂ŷᵢ = −yᵢ/ŷᵢ + (1−yᵢ)/(1−ŷᵢ)

Step 2 — derivative of sigmoid with respect to z:
    ∂ŷᵢ/∂zᵢ = σ(zᵢ)(1 − σ(zᵢ)) = ŷᵢ(1 − ŷᵢ)

Step 3 — chain rule (∂L/∂z = ∂L/∂ŷ · ∂ŷ/∂z):
    ∂L/∂zᵢ = [−yᵢ/ŷᵢ + (1−yᵢ)/(1−ŷᵢ)] · ŷᵢ(1−ŷᵢ)
            = −yᵢ(1−ŷᵢ) + (1−yᵢ)ŷᵢ
            = ŷᵢ − yᵢ                                   ← the cancellation!

The ŷᵢ(1−ŷᵢ) in step 2 exactly cancels the denominators in step 1. This is why
cross-entropy and sigmoid were designed to pair together — they are the canonical
matched pair for Bernoulli MLE, and their combination produces the cleanest possible
gradient.

Step 4 — chain rule down to weights (∂z/∂wⱼ = xᵢⱼ):
    ∂L/∂wⱼ = (1/n) Σᵢ (ŷᵢ − yᵢ) · xᵢⱼ

In matrix form:  ∇L = (1/n) Xᵀ(ŷ − y)   ← clean, elegant, computationally simple.


### Weight Update Rule:

                        w := w − α · (1/n) Xᵀ(ŷ − y)

where ŷ = σ(Xw) must be recomputed at each step since ŷ depends on the current w.


### Concrete Training Walkthrough:

Let's trace two full iterations training a logistic regression from scratch on a
2D binary classification problem.

    Initial weights: w₀ = 0 (bias), w₁ = 0.0, w₂ = 0.0
    Learning rate: α = 0.1

    === EPOCH 1 ===

    Step 1 — Compute z (linear combination) for all 4 examples:
        z₁ = 0 + 0×2 + 0×1 = 0.0
        z₂ = 0 + 0×1 + 0×2 = 0.0
        z₃ = 0 + 0×(-1) + 0×(-1) = 0.0
        z₄ = 0 + 0×(-2) + 0×(-2) = 0.0

    Step 2 — Apply sigmoid to get predicted probabilities:
        ŷ₁ = σ(0) = 0.500
        ŷ₂ = σ(0) = 0.500
        ŷ₃ = σ(0) = 0.500
        ŷ₄ = σ(0) = 0.500

    Step 3 — Compute errors (ŷ - y_true):
        error₁ = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5   (should be 1, predicted 0.5)
        error₂ = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5   (should be 1, predicted 0.5)
        error₃ = 0.5 - 0 = +0.5   (should be 0, predicted 0.5)
        error₄ = 0.5 - 0 = +0.5   (should be 0, predicted 0.5)

    Step 4 — Compute gradients:

        ∂L/∂w₀ = (1/4)[(-0.5)(1) + (-0.5)(1) + (0.5)(1) + (0.5)(1)]
               = (1/4)[−0.5 − 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5] = 0.0

        ∂L/∂w₁ = (1/4)[(-0.5)(2) + (-0.5)(1) + (0.5)(-1) + (0.5)(-2)]
               = (1/4)[−1 − 0.5 − 0.5 − 1] = (1/4)(−3) = −0.75

        ∂L/∂w₂ = (1/4)[(-0.5)(1) + (-0.5)(2) + (0.5)(-1) + (0.5)(-2)]
               = (1/4)[−0.5 − 1 − 0.5 − 1] = (1/4)(−3) = −0.75

    Step 5 — Update weights (w := w − α · ∇L):
        w₀ := 0.0 − 0.1 × 0.0  = 0.000
        w₁ := 0.0 − 0.1 × (−0.75) = +0.075
        w₂ := 0.0 − 0.1 × (−0.75) = +0.075

    After epoch 1: w₀=0.000, w₁=0.075, w₂=0.075

    Intuition: the gradient is negative for w₁ and w₂, so we increase both weights.
    The positive-class examples (2,1) and (1,2) have larger feature values than the
    negative-class examples (-1,-1) and (-2,-2). Increasing w₁ and w₂ will produce
    larger z for positive examples and smaller z for negative examples — correct!

    === EPOCH 2 ===

    Step 1 — New z values with updated weights:
        z₁ = 0 + 0.075×2 + 0.075×1 = 0.225
        z₂ = 0 + 0.075×1 + 0.075×2 = 0.225
        z₃ = 0 + 0.075×(-1) + 0.075×(-1) = -0.150
        z₄ = 0 + 0.075×(-2) + 0.075×(-2) = -0.300

    Step 2 — Apply sigmoid:
        ŷ₁ = σ(0.225) ≈ 0.556
        ŷ₂ = σ(0.225) ≈ 0.556
        ŷ₃ = σ(−0.15) ≈ 0.463
        ŷ₄ = σ(−0.30) ≈ 0.426

    Already better: class 1 examples (≈0.556) getting higher probability than
    class 0 examples (≈0.426−0.463). The model is learning the boundary.

    After many more iterations, the weights will converge to values that clearly
    separate the two classes, with w₁ and w₂ both positive and large enough that
    positive-class examples produce σ(z) ≫ 0.5.

### Part 4: The Decision Boundary — What Is the Model Geometry?


### The Decision Boundary Is Always a Hyperplane:

The logistic regression model predicts class 1 when σ(z) ≥ 0.5, which is when z ≥ 0.
The decision boundary is therefore:

                        w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₚxₚ = 0

This is the equation of a hyperplane — in 2D, a straight line; in 3D, a flat plane.
The decision boundary of logistic regression is always linear, regardless of the
probability values on either side.

This is the same structural insight from the perceptron: the weight vector W is
perpendicular to the decision boundary and points toward the positive class. The bias
w₀ shifts the boundary away from the origin.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — The Linear Decision Boundary in 2D:**

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Above the boundary (w·x > 0):  σ(z) > 0.5  →  Class 1
    Below the boundary (w·x < 0):  σ(z) < 0.5  →  Class 0

    └──────────────────────────────────→ x₁
                     ↓ low ŷ (confident class 0)

    Probabilities "spread out" from the decision boundary symmetrically.
    The further from the boundary, the more confident the prediction.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Log-Odds (Logit) Interpretation:

There is a beautiful algebraic way to see what logistic regression is actually fitting.
Define the odds of class 1 as P/(1-P). Taking the log:

                log[ŷ/(1 − ŷ)] = w·x + b

The left side is the log-odds (called the logit). The right side is a linear function.
So logistic regression is actually fitting a linear model for the log-odds, not for the
probability directly:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  Logistic regression is linear regression for the log-odds │
    │                                                             │
    │  logit(P(y=1|x)) = w·x + b                                 │
    │                                                             │
    │  A unit increase in feature j multiplies the odds by eʷʲ   │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This is why the weights in logistic regression are interpreted as log-odds ratios.
If w₁ = 0.5 for the "age" feature, then each additional year of age multiplies
the odds of the outcome by e^0.5 ≈ 1.65 — i.e., increases odds by 65%.

    Log-odds are LINEAR in z.          Probability is NONLINEAR (S-curve).
    This is what the model fits.       This is what we interpret.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### When Does Logistic Regression Fail?

The linear decision boundary is both the strength and limitation of logistic regression.

**Fails on XOR (non-linear separation):**

    Class 0:  (−1, −1), (+1, +1)     ← same sign inputs → class 0
    Class 1:  (−1, +1), (+1, −1)     ← different sign inputs → class 1

No straight line can separate these classes. The optimal boundary is curved (hyperbolic).
Logistic regression will perform no better than random on this problem.

**Fixes for non-linear boundaries:**

1. Feature engineering: add x₁² , x₂², x₁x₂ as new features (Polynomial Logistic Regression)
2. Kernel methods: implicitly map to high-dimensional space (Kernel SVM)
3. Stack multiple logistic regression units with non-linear activation → Neural Network

This is the direct bridge to neural networks: a hidden layer transforms the input
into a new representation where the classes may be linearly separable, and then
logistic regression is applied in that transformed space.


### Part 5: Regularisation

Same L1/L2 penalty as linear regression. In sklearn, the parameter is `C = 1/λ`
(inverse of regularisation strength — larger C = less regularisation).

### Why Regularisation Matters More for Logistic Regression:

In linear regression, overfitting typically manifests as large weight magnitudes but
the model still gives real-valued outputs. In logistic regression, large weights are
more dangerous: if w is very large, σ(z) is almost exactly 0 or 1 for most training
examples. The model becomes extremely overconfident.

Worse: with large weights, the gradient σ(z)(1−σ(z)) approaches zero for most
examples (since σ(z) ≈ 0 or ≈ 1 → σ(1−σ) ≈ 0). Gradient descent essentially
stops updating — the model is saturated. Regularisation prevents this.

**L2 Regularisation (Ridge Logistic Regression):**

        L_Ridge = BCE + (λ/2n) Σⱼ wⱼ²

The gradient adds a term λ/n · wⱼ to each weight update:

        w := w − α · [(1/n) Xᵀ(ŷ − y) + (λ/n) w]

**L1 Regularisation (Lasso Logistic Regression):**

        L_Lasso = BCE + (λ/n) Σⱼ |wⱼ|

Forces some weights to exactly zero — useful for high-dimensional problems where
many features are irrelevant (e.g., text classification with 50,000 word features).

**sklearn Convention:** sklearn uses C = 1/λ (inverse of regularisation strength).
    - C = 1 (default): moderate regularisation
    - C → ∞: no regularisation (equivalent to plain logistic regression)
    - C → 0: very heavy regularisation, weights approach zero


### The Generalisation Gap:

Just as in linear regression, the difference between training loss and test loss is
the generalisation gap. Logistic regression can overfit severely when:
    - The number of features p is large relative to n (high-dimensional data)
    - Features are very predictive of training labels but noisy on new data
    - Training data is not representative of the test distribution

Regularisation (L1 or L2) directly reduces the generalisation gap by penalising
complexity, trading a small increase in training loss for a larger decrease in test loss.

---

### Part 6: Multi-Class Extensions

- **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** — train k binary classifiers (one per class)
- **Softmax Regression** — direct multi-class generalisation

softmax(zⱼ) = e^zⱼ / Σₖ e^zₖ


### One-vs-Rest (OvR):

For k classes, train k independent binary classifiers. Classifier j answers:
"Is this example class j or not?" To predict, run all k classifiers and pick
the one with the highest predicted probability.

    Class A classifier: P(y = A | x) = σ(wₐ·x)
    Class B classifier: P(y = B | x) = σ(w_b·x)
    Class C classifier: P(y = C | x) = σ(w_c·x)
    
    Predict: argmax over {A, B, C} of their respective σ outputs

Simple but the k probabilities don't sum to 1 (they're from independent models).


### Softmax Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression):

The natural multi-class generalisation. Instead of k independent sigmoids, use one
joint model with k weight vectors {w₁, ..., wₖ}:

            P(y = j | x) = exp(wⱼ·x) / Σₖ exp(wₖ·x) = softmax(z)ⱼ

Properties of softmax:
- All class probabilities are in (0, 1)
- They sum to exactly 1 → valid probability distribution
- The largest zⱼ gets the largest probability (argmax-like but smooth)
- Reduces to sigmoid when k = 2


    # ======================================================================================= # 
    **Diagram 6 — Softmax Spreads Probability Across Classes:**

    SOFTMAX: k=3 classes, linear scores z = [2.0, 1.0, 0.5]
    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    Raw scores z:    Class A = 2.0    Class B = 1.0    Class C = 0.5

    Step 1 — Exponentiate:
        exp(2.0) = 7.39    exp(1.0) = 2.72    exp(0.5) = 1.65

    Step 2 — Sum: 7.39 + 2.72 + 1.65 = 11.76

    Step 3 — Divide:
        P(A) = 7.39 / 11.76 = 0.629
        P(B) = 2.72 / 11.76 = 0.231
        P(C) = 1.65 / 11.76 = 0.140
        ─────────────────────────────
        Sum  =                1.000 ✓

    The class with the highest score (A) gets the majority of probability,
    but the others are not ignored — their probabilities reflect their scores.

    COMPARE: Binary sigmoid gives P(class 1) = 0.88 for z = 2.0
             Softmax with k=2 gives identical results as sigmoid
             Softmax with k > 2 is the natural generalisation
    # ======================================================================================= # 


### Cross-Entropy for Multi-Class (Categorical Cross-Entropy):

The loss extends naturally from binary BCE to k classes:

        L = -(1/n) Σᵢ Σⱼ yᵢⱼ log(ŷᵢⱼ)

Where yᵢⱼ = 1 if example i belongs to class j (and 0 otherwise). This is a
one-hot encoding over classes. For a correctly classified example, only the
true class term is active — the others are multiplied by zero. The loss reduces
to: -log(probability assigned to the true class).

This is the same loss used in the output layer of every multi-class neural network.

---

Decision Boundary

The boundary is the set of points where `wᵀx = 0`. It's always **linear** in feature space.
For non-linear boundaries, you need:
- Polynomial feature expansion
- Kernels (SVM)
- Neural networks

---

### Part 7: From Logistic Regression to Deep Learning


### The Direct Connection:

A single logistic regression unit and a single neuron in a neural network are the
same computation:

                    output = σ(w·x + b)

The only difference is where in the architecture they appear:
- Logistic regression: this is the entire model
- Neural network: this is one neuron in one layer

A neural network is literally stacks of logistic regression units (with various
activation functions) organised in layers, where the output of each layer is the
input to the next. The last layer's sigmoid (or softmax) is the direct descendant
of logistic regression.

This is the full progression:

    Perceptron (1958)          ← step activation, binary prediction, no gradient
          │
          │  (replace step with sigmoid, use BCE loss)
          ↓
    Logistic Regression         ← sigmoid activation, probability output, MLE training
          │
          │  (stack multiple logistic regression units in layers)
          ↓
    Multi-Layer Perceptron      ← hidden layers transform input into separable space
          │
          │  (replace sigmoid with ReLU, add depth)
          ↓
    Deep Neural Networks        ← universal function approximators


**Why Logistic Regression is Not Enough:**

Logistic regression can only find a linear decision boundary. Composing multiple
logistic regression units — one layer — still gives a linear boundary (linear
compositions of linear functions are linear). The key breakthrough of neural networks
is that adding non-linear activation functions between layers creates non-linear
transformations of the input, allowing the final linear classifier to operate in a
"transformed" space where the classes may be separable.

This is why the activation function is non-negotiable in deep learning: without it,
the depth of a network is irrelevant.
