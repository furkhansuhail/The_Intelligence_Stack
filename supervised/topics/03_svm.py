Support Vector Machines — Maximum-Margin Classification
========================================================

SVMs approach classification from a fundamentally different angle than logistic
regression. Rather than asking "what is the probability of class 1?", SVMs ask:
"what is the widest possible street we can draw between the two classes?"

This geometric intuition — maximising the margin — leads to a powerful algorithm
that finds the unique optimal decision boundary, not just any boundary that works.

## 03 · Support Vector Machines

SVMs find the **hyperplane** that maximises the margin between two classes. Instead of just
finding any separating boundary, SVM finds the one with the largest possible gap.

### What is a Support Vector Machine?

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a binary classification algorithm that finds the
hyperplane separating two classes with the maximum possible margin — the widest "street"
that fits between the two classes with no data points inside it.

This might sound similar to logistic regression, which also finds a linear decision
boundary. But the objectives are fundamentally different:

    Logistic Regression: find the boundary that maximises the likelihood of the data
                         (equivalent to minimising cross-entropy loss)

    SVM:                 find the boundary that maximises the margin — the distance
                         between the boundary and the closest points of each class

The result is that SVMs find a unique, optimal boundary determined entirely by a
small subset of the training data (the support vectors), while logistic regression
is influenced by every training point.

Think of it as building a road between two cities. Logistic regression draws a road
that best fits all the data points on both sides. SVM finds the widest possible road —
it maximises the empty space between the two classes, ignoring distant points and
focusing only on the ones right at the edge.

    Things that exist inside the model (learnable parameters):
        - Weight vector w  — orientation of the decision hyperplane
        - Bias b           — offset of the hyperplane from the origin
        - Support vectors  — the subset of training points that define the boundary

    Things that exist only at setup time (hyperparameters):
        - C               — regularisation (margin width vs. misclassification tradeoff)
        - Kernel type     — linear, RBF, polynomial, sigmoid
        - Kernel params   — γ for RBF, degree d for polynomial

### SVM as Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM)

SVM fits cleanly into the ERM framework, but with a different loss function than
anything we've seen so far:

Comparing the ERM formulations across the series:
    Linear Regression:    MSE loss,            no structural penalty
    Logistic Regression:  BCE loss,            L2 penalty (Ridge) optional
    SVM:                  Hinge loss,          L2 penalty (1/2||w||²) built-in

The L2 penalty in SVM is not optional regularisation added on top — it is the
primary objective. Maximising the margin IS minimising ||w||².

The maximum-margin inductive bias has a theoretical justification through
Structural Risk Minimisation (Vapnik, 1990s): maximising the margin minimises
an upper bound on the generalisation error, even without assumptions about the
data distribution. This is different from logistic regression, whose guarantees
rely on the Bernoulli likelihood assumption being correct.

### Part 1: Hard-Margin SVM — The Geometry

For linearly separable data, find `w, b` such that:
- `wᵀxᵢ + b ≥ +1` for class +1
- `wᵀxᵢ + b ≤ -1` for class -1

The margin width is `2/||w||`. To **maximise** margin, we **minimise** `||w||²`.

Only the points closest to the boundary — the **support vectors** — determine the hyperplane.
All other training points can be removed without changing the solution.


For binary classification with labels y ∈ {−1, +1}, the SVM decision function is:

                        f(x) = sign(w·x + b)

A point is predicted class +1 if w·x + b > 0, and class −1 if w·x + b < 0.

The decision boundary is the hyperplane w·x + b = 0. The margin is the total width
of the gap between the two classes measured perpendicularly to this hyperplane.

For a correctly classified point xᵢ with label yᵢ ∈ {−1, +1}, the functional margin
is yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b). The hard-margin SVM requires this to be at least 1 for all points:

                    yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1      for all i

Points where yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) = 1 exactly — those sitting right on the margin edges —
are the support vectors. Everything else is further away and doesn't affect the solution.


### The Margin Width:

The geometric margin (actual perpendicular distance from a point to the hyperplane) is:

                        geometric margin = yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) / ||w||

For points on the margin edges (functional margin = 1), the geometric distance to the
decision boundary is exactly 1/||w||. The two class margins are on opposite sides, so
the total margin width is:

                            margin = 2/||w||

Maximising the margin means maximising 2/||w||, which is equivalent to minimising ||w||².

### The Hard-Margin Optimisation Problem:

Formally, hard-margin SVM solves a constrained quadratic program:

    Primal:
        minimise    (1/2)||w||²
        subject to  yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1    for all i = 1,...,n

This is a convex quadratic objective with linear constraints — there is exactly one
global minimum and it can be found efficiently even for millions of dimensions.

**Why (1/2)||w||² instead of ||w||?**

The factor of 1/2 is a calculus convenience: the derivative of (1/2)||w||² is exactly
w (no factor of 2). The square makes the function strictly convex and differentiable
everywhere. The 1/2 factor doesn't change the solution.

**What changes if data is not linearly separable?**

The hard-margin problem becomes infeasible — the constraints cannot all be satisfied
simultaneously. Soft-margin SVM (Part 2) handles this by allowing violations.


### The Dual Problem and Why It Matters:

The primal hard-margin SVM can be rewritten in its Lagrangian dual form:

    Dual:
        maximise    Σᵢ αᵢ - (1/2) Σᵢ Σⱼ αᵢ αⱼ yᵢ yⱼ (xᵢ·xⱼ)
        subject to  αᵢ ≥ 0    and    Σᵢ αᵢ yᵢ = 0

Where αᵢ are Lagrange multipliers — one per training example. The KKT conditions
(Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) tell us that:
    - αᵢ = 0      for non-support-vector points (correctly classified with margin > 1)
    - αᵢ > 0      for support vectors (on the margin exactly)

The weight vector is recovered as:

                        w = Σᵢ αᵢ yᵢ xᵢ

Only support vectors (αᵢ > 0) contribute to w. This is the sparsity property.

**The crucial observation:** the dual objective only involves dot products xᵢ·xⱼ
between training examples. This is the doorway to the kernel trick (Part 3).

### Part 2: Soft-Margin SVM (C parameter) — Handling Real Data

Real data is never perfectly separable. Introduce slack variables `ξᵢ ≥ 0`:

Minimise: (1/2)||w||² + C Σ ξᵢ

- **Large C** → narrow margin, fewer violations (overfitting risk)
- **Small C** → wider margin, more violations (underfitting risk)


### Why Hard Margins Fail:

Real data is almost never perfectly linearly separable. Even if the classes are
fundamentally separable, noise and outliers will produce points on the wrong side.
Hard-margin SVM refuses to find a solution in this case.

Soft-margin SVM relaxes the constraints by introducing slack variables ξᵢ ≥ 0:

                    yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1 − ξᵢ       for all i

Where ξᵢ measures how far a point violates the margin:
    ξᵢ = 0:         point correctly classified, outside or on the margin
    0 < ξᵢ ≤ 1:    point inside the margin but still on the correct side
    ξᵢ > 1:         point on the wrong side of the decision boundary (misclassified)


### The Soft-Margin Objective:

    minimise    (1/2)||w||²  +  C · Σᵢ ξᵢ
    subject to  yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1 − ξᵢ,    ξᵢ ≥ 0    for all i

The parameter C controls the tradeoff between margin width and constraint violations:

### The Hinge Loss Connection:

The soft-margin SVM objective can be rewritten without slack variables by substituting
ξᵢ = max(0, 1 − yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b)):

    minimise    (1/2)||w||²  +  C · Σᵢ max(0, 1 − yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b))

        m > 1   : outside margin, penalty = 0  (ignored completely!)

    LOGISTIC LOSS: log(1 + exp(-m))
        Never reaches exactly zero — every point gets some gradient
        Smooth and differentiable everywhere

                → only support vectors matter → sparse solution
    Logistic:   every point contributes gradient → dense solution

    SVM loss = (1/2)(1.0)² + C × (0 + 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0 + 0.5)
             = 0.5 + C × 1.0

    With C = 1: total loss = 1.5
    The two in-margin violators (x=1 and x=0) are the only ones contributing
    to the hinge loss term. All other points contribute zero.

### Part 3: The Kernel Trick — Non-Linear SVM

SVM computes dot products `xᵢᵀxⱼ`. Replace with a **kernel function** `K(xᵢ, xⱼ)`:

| Kernel       | Formula           | Use Case                   |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Linear       | `xᵀz`             | Already linearly separable |
| RBF/Gaussian | `exp(-γ||x-z||²)` | Most general-purpose       |
| Polynomial   | `(xᵀz + c)^d`     | Image classification       |

The kernel implicitly maps to a higher-dimensional space without computing it explicitly.

Linear SVM can only find linear decision boundaries. Many real classification problems
require curved boundaries. Rather than redesigning the algorithm, the kernel trick
achieves non-linearity through a conceptually elegant manoeuvre:

    Map the data to a higher-dimensional feature space where the classes
    ARE linearly separable, then find the maximum-margin hyperplane there.

The remarkable insight: we never need to compute this mapping explicitly.


### Feature Maps:

A feature map φ: ℝᵖ → ℝᵈ (where d ≫ p or even d = ∞) transforms each input into
a higher-dimensional space. The linear SVM in that space corresponds to a non-linear
boundary in the original space.

Example: 2D input → polynomial feature map:
    φ([x₁, x₂]) = [1, x₁, x₂, x₁², x₁x₂, x₂²]    (degree-2 polynomial features)

After mapping, a linear boundary in 6D corresponds to a quadratic curve in 2D.

This is exactly the feature engineering approach from logistic regression (Part 4) —
but instead of hand-crafting features, the kernel trick makes it automatic and
computationally tractable even when d is infinite.


### The Kernel Function:

The SVM dual objective only involves dot products between training examples:

                Σᵢ αᵢ − (1/2) Σᵢ Σⱼ αᵢ αⱼ yᵢ yⱼ (xᵢ · xⱼ)

After feature mapping, the dot products become:

                (xᵢ · xⱼ)  →  (φ(xᵢ) · φ(xⱼ))

A kernel function K(xᵢ, xⱼ) computes this dot product in the feature space directly,
without explicitly computing φ(xᵢ):

                K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = φ(xᵢ) · φ(xⱼ)

This is the kernel trick: replace every dot product in the SVM algorithm with a
kernel evaluation. We get the full power of the high-dimensional feature space at
the computational cost of operating in the original space.

    Classes mixed in 2D            Separation emerges in feature space

    THE TRICK:
    We never actually compute φ(x) = [x₁, x₂, x₁², x₁x₂, x₂², ...]
    We only compute K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = φ(xᵢ)·φ(xⱼ) directly

    Example: Polynomial kernel of degree 2:
    K(x, z) = (x·z + 1)²
             = (x₁z₁ + x₂z₂ + 1)²
             = ... expanded ...
             = φ(x)·φ(z)    where φ maps to 6D
    Cost of K(x,z): O(p)    ← just 2 dot products in original space
    Cost of φ(x)·φ(z): O(p²) ← must compute all cross terms
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Standard Kernels:

**Linear Kernel:**
    K(x, z) = x·z
    Equivalent to standard linear SVM. No feature expansion.
    Use when: data is already linearly separable or p is very large (text).

**Polynomial Kernel (degree d):**
    K(x, z) = (x·z + c)^d
    Implicitly computes all polynomial features up to degree d.
    Use when: features have multiplicative interactions.
    Hyperparameters: d (degree), c (bias term, usually 0 or 1).

**Radial Basis Function / Gaussian Kernel:**
    K(x, z) = exp(−γ||x − z||²)
    Implicitly maps to INFINITE-dimensional feature space.
    Effectively: similarity measure based on distance.
    When γ is small → wide similarity → smooth, simple boundary.
    When γ is large → narrow similarity → complex, jagged boundary.
    Use when: no prior knowledge about feature structure. Most general-purpose.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 5 — RBF Kernel: The "Infinite Feature Space" Intuition:**

    RBF KERNEL: K(x, z) = exp(−γ||x − z||²)
    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    The RBF kernel measures SIMILARITY between two points:
        x and z very close     → ||x-z||² ≈ 0   → K ≈ 1 (similar)
        x and z far apart      → ||x-z||² large → K ≈ 0 (different)

    EFFECT OF γ:
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Small γ (e.g. 0.01):            Large γ (e.g. 100):
    Wide "similarity bell curve"    Narrow "similarity bell curve"

### Mercer's Theorem — What Makes a Valid Kernel?

Not every function K(x, z) is a valid kernel (i.e., corresponds to a dot product
in some feature space). A function is a valid kernel if and only if the kernel matrix
K (where Kᵢⱼ = K(xᵢ, xⱼ)) is positive semi-definite for any training set.

This is Mercer's theorem. It guarantees:
    1. A valid feature space φ exists (even if infinite-dimensional)
    2. The SVM dual problem remains convex (global minimum exists)
    3. The model is still interpretable as a linear classifier in feature space

All three standard kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) are valid by Mercer's theorem.
The sigmoid kernel K(x,z) = tanh(αx·z + c) is NOT always valid — it violates Mercer's
condition for some parameter values.

### Part 4: Support Vectors — The Defining Points


### What Are Support Vectors?

Support vectors are the training points that lie exactly on the margin boundaries
(or violate them, in soft-margin SVM). They are the only points that matter for
defining the decision boundary.

From the dual formulation: w = Σᵢ αᵢ yᵢ xᵢ, where αᵢ > 0 only for support vectors.

This means:
    - You can discard all non-support-vector training points
    - The solution remains identical
    - Predictions on new points depend only on their similarity to support vectors:
        f(x) = sign(Σᵢ αᵢ yᵢ K(xᵢ, x) + b)


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 6 — Support Vectors Define the Boundary:**

    x₂ ↑
       │     ●  ●  ●                 Support vectors: the points with boxes
       │   ●  ●                      All other points: irrelevant to the solution
       │  ●
       │ [●]──────────────── ← positive margin (w·x+b = +1)
       │      ← MARGIN →
       │ ─────────────────── ← decision boundary (w·x+b = 0)
       │      ← MARGIN →
       │ [○]──────────────── ← negative margin (w·x+b = -1)
       │   ○
       │  ○   ○  ○
       └─────────────────────────────────────────────→ x₁

    [●] and [○] are support vectors. αᵢ > 0 for these points.
    All ● and ○ without brackets: αᵢ = 0, contribute nothing to w.

    ROBUSTNESS PROPERTY:
    Moving a non-support-vector farther away → solution unchanged
    Moving a support vector → boundary shifts

    COMPARE WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
    Logistic: every point contributes gradient → boundary influenced by all points
    SVM:      only support vectors matter → robust to most outliers
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Support Vectors and Generalisation:

The number of support vectors is a measure of model complexity:
    Few SVs:   wide margin, simple boundary, good generalisation
    Many SVs:  narrow margin, complex boundary, risk of overfitting

In kernel SVM, each support vector is a "basis function" in the decision function.
With RBF kernel, many SVs = many local bumps in the decision boundary = overfitting.

The number of support vectors grows with:
    - Smaller C (allows more violations, so more points fall inside the margin)
    - Larger γ (narrower similarity, more points needed to define the boundary)
    - More noise in the data (more violations → more support vectors)

---

### Part 5: SVM vs Logistic Regression — A Deep Comparison

- SVM cares only about support vectors (robust to most outliers)
- Logistic Regression uses all points; outputs calibrated probabilities
- Both are linear in their feature space; kernel SVM is non-linear

The two algorithms solve similar problems but from different perspectives.

### When to Use SVM vs Logistic Regression:

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Choose SVM when:                                            │
    │    • High-dimensional data with few features (text, genes)   │
    │    • n < ~100k samples (kernel SVM doesn't scale to large n) │
    │    • Non-linear boundaries needed (use RBF kernel)           │
    │    • Calibrated probabilities NOT required                   │
    │    • Robustness to outliers matters                          │
    │                                                              │
    │  Choose Logistic Regression when:                            │
    │    • Calibrated output probabilities needed                  │
    │    • n is very large (SGD scales well)                       │
    │    • Online learning (streaming data)                        │
    │    • Interpretability of weights is important                │
    │    • Feature selection needed (L1 logistic)                  │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


### Hinge Loss vs Logistic Loss — A Probabilistic Connection:

Both losses are upper bounds on the 0-1 loss (the true classification error):

    0-1 loss:      L₀₁(m) = 1[m < 0]   (1 if wrong, 0 if right)
    Hinge loss:    L_H(m)  = max(0, 1−m) ≥ L₀₁(m)   always
    Logistic loss: L_L(m)  = log(1+e⁻ᵐ) ≥ L₀₁(m)   always

Minimising either bound drives the 0-1 loss down. The choice determines which
points receive gradient:
    Hinge: zero gradient for m > 1 (correctly classified with margin) → sparse
    Logistic: non-zero gradient everywhere → dense, all points matter

### Part 6: From SVM to Deep Learning


### The Historical Arc:

SVMs dominated machine learning from the mid-1990s to around 2012. They had strong
theoretical guarantees (Structural Risk Minimisation), worked well on small/medium
datasets, and with the kernel trick, could learn highly non-linear boundaries.

The 2012 ImageNet competition changed everything: deep neural networks outperformed
kernel SVMs by a massive margin on image recognition. The reason was scale: neural
networks benefited from more data and more compute in a way that kernel SVMs could not.

**Why kernel SVM doesn't scale:**
    - The kernel matrix K is n×n → storing it costs O(n²) memory
    - Training requires solving an n×n quadratic program → O(n³) worst case
    - With n = 1,000,000, this is completely infeasible
    - Neural networks scale as O(n·p·layers) — far more manageable

**What SVM contributed to deep learning:**
    - The hinge loss is used in neural networks (e.g., multi-class SVM loss)
    - The kernel intuition motivated network architecture design
    - RBF networks (radial basis function networks) are direct neural network
      implementations of kernel machines
    - Support vector regression (SVR) introduced ε-insensitive loss, used in
      modern robust regression


### The Connection to Neural Networks:

A neural network can be seen as learning its own feature map φ, while an SVM fixes
φ via the kernel choice and finds the optimal linear boundary in that feature space.

    SVM (kernel):  fix φ (via kernel), optimise linear boundary
    Neural Net:    learn φ (via hidden layers), learn linear boundary at output

Neural networks generalise SVM by making the feature representation itself learnable.
The last layer of any classification neural network is logistic regression (or softmax)
applied to the learned representation — which is equivalent to a linear SVM in that
learned feature space.

The full progression:

    Perceptron (1958)              ← linear, hard 0/1, no probability
          │
          │  (soft boundary, probabilities, MLE)
          ↓
    Logistic Regression (1958+)    ← linear, probabilistic, BCE loss
          │
          │  (maximum margin objective, hinge loss, structural risk minimisation)
          ↓
    SVM (1992–1995)                ← linear or kernel, geometric, margin maximisation
          │
          │  (learn φ rather than fixing it; scale to large data)
          ↓
    Neural Networks (2012+)        ← learn non-linear φ, scale to billions of examples

LINEAR SVM FROM SCRATCH — HINGE LOSS + SUBGRADIENT DESCENT
================================================================================

We implement the primal soft-margin SVM objective directly:

    L(w, b) = (1/2)||w||²  +  C · Σᵢ max(0, 1 − yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b))
               ↑ margin term         ↑ hinge loss sum

The hinge loss max(0, 1−m) is not differentiable at m = 1 (the kink).
We use the subgradient:
    ∂/∂w  hinge(m) = 0         if m > 1   (correct, outside margin)
                   = -yᵢxᵢ    if m ≤ 1   (inside margin or wrong side)

This is a simplified SGD-based SVM — the same approach used by liblinear
for large-scale linear SVMs.

  IMPORTANT: C means different things in SVM vs Logistic Regression.

  SVM (sklearn):
    Objective: (1/2)||w||²  + C × hinge_loss
    C controls: how much to penalise VIOLATIONS
    Large C → narrow margin, penalise violations heavily (may overfit)
    Small C → wide margin, tolerate violations (regularised)
    C ↑ = LESS regularisation

  Logistic Regression (sklearn):
    Objective: C × BCE  + (1/2)||w||²    (sklearn uses C = 1/λ convention)
    Large C → less L2 penalty, fits data tightly (may overfit)
    Small C → more L2 penalty, regularised
    C ↑ = LESS regularisation   (same direction as SVM)

  BUT the loss scale is different, so optimal C values are not comparable
  between the two algorithms. Always tune C separately for each.

  Summary:
  {'C value':>12} | {'SVM interpretation':>30} | {'LR interpretation':>30}
  {'-'*12}-+-{'-'*30}-+-{'-'*30}
  {'C=0.001':>12} | {'very wide margin (heavy reg.)':>30} | {'heavy L2 regularisation':>30}

  {'C=1000':>12} | {'narrow margin, hard constraints':>30} | {'almost no regularisation':>30}

  In both cases: larger C = less regularisation, smaller C = more regularisation.
