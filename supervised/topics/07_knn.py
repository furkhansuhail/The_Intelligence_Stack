K-Nearest Neighbours — Learning by Analogy
===========================================

K-Nearest Neighbours is the most literal implementation of the intuition that
"similar inputs should have similar outputs." To classify a new point, KNN simply
finds the K training examples closest to it and takes a majority vote. To predict
a continuous value, it averages those K neighbours' targets.

There is no training phase. No parameters are fitted. No loss function is minimised.
KNN stores the entire training set and defers all computation to prediction time.
This makes it unique among every algorithm in this series — it is the only
instance-based, non-parametric, lazy learner we will study.

Its simplicity is both its strength and its weakness: KNN requires no modelling
assumptions and adapts perfectly to any decision boundary shape, but it scales
poorly, suffers in high dimensions, and is sensitive to irrelevant features.

### What is K-Nearest Neighbours?

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is a non-parametric learning algorithm that makes
predictions by finding the K most similar training examples to a query point and
aggregating their labels or values.

It is the algorithmic embodiment of reasoning by analogy: "This patient has
similar age, blood pressure, and cholesterol to three patients who had heart
attacks — so we should be worried about this one too."

KNN is radically different from every other algorithm in this series:

    Every other model:  trains a compact model (weights, trees, support vectors)
                        → discards training data after fitting
                        → prediction is fast (evaluate the compact model)

    KNN:                stores the ENTIRE training set
                        → no fitting phase at all
                        → prediction requires searching ALL training points

This "lazy" learning strategy is why KNN is called a lazy learner or
instance-based learner: it defers all computation to query time.

    Things that exist inside the model (stored, not learned):
        - The complete training dataset {(xᵢ, yᵢ)}   — memorised verbatim

    Things you control before querying (hyperparameters):
        - K                     — number of neighbours to consider
        - Distance metric       — how to measure "similarity"
        - Weighting scheme      — equal votes vs inverse-distance weights


### KNN in the ERM Framework — A Special Case

KNN does not fit naturally into the ERM framework because there is no explicit
optimisation over any parameters. It is a memorisation algorithm, not a
minimisation algorithm. We can still describe what it implicitly does:

    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The locality assumption is the weakest possible inductive bias — KNN makes fewer
assumptions than any other model we've studied. This is both its strength (nothing
is assumed away) and its weakness (high data requirements to compensate).

### Part 1: The Algorithm


### Classification:

For a query point x_q:
    1. Compute distance d(x_q, xᵢ) for every training point xᵢ
    2. Sort training points by distance to x_q
    3. Take the K closest points: {x₁, x₂, ..., x_K} (nearest first)
    4. Return majority class: ŷ = argmax_c  Σᵢ 1[yᵢ = c]

**Tie-breaking** (when two classes tie for the majority vote):
    - If K is even, ties are possible — sklearn picks the lower class index
    - Choose K to be odd for binary classification to avoid ties


### Regression:

For a query point x_q:
    1–3. Same: find K nearest neighbours
    4. Return mean of their target values:  ŷ = (1/K) Σᵢ yᵢ

**Weighted KNN:** give closer neighbours more influence:
    ŷ = Σᵢ (1/d(x_q, xᵢ)) · yᵢ  /  Σᵢ (1/d(x_q, xᵢ))

Weighting by inverse distance is usually better than equal voting because a very
close neighbour should carry more information than a distant one.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 1 — KNN Classification (K=3 and K=7):**

    Dataset: ● = Class A,  ○ = Class B,  ? = query point

    K=3:                                    K=7:
    x₂ ↑                                    x₂ ↑
       │    ●   ○                               │    ●   ○
       │  ●   ●   ○                             │  ●   ●   ○
       │      (?)  ○                            │      (?)  ○
       │        ○                               │        ○
       │  ●                                     │  ●
       └──────────────────→ x₁                  └──────────────────→ x₁

    K=3 nearest: ●, ●, ○  → majority = ●  → predict Class A
    K=7 nearest: ●, ●, ○, ○, ○, ●, ○  → majority = ○  → predict Class B

    DIFFERENT K → DIFFERENT ANSWER!
    Small K: complex, jagged boundary (low bias, high variance)
    Large K: smooth, stable boundary (high bias, low variance)
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Decision Boundary of KNN:

For K=1, KNN creates a Voronoi diagram: the decision boundary runs exactly midway
between training points of different classes. Every test point is assigned to the
class of the single nearest training point.

For K > 1, the boundary is smoothed — a larger neighbourhood is consulted,
and the boundary becomes less sensitive to individual training points.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 2 — K=1 Voronoi Tessellation:**

    Every point in space "belongs" to its nearest training example.
    The decision boundary between regions is always midway between
    training points of different classes.

    x₂ ↑
       │ ●│○│ ○ │
       │──┼─┼───│  ← decision boundary (equidistant lines)
       │ ●│●│ ○ │
       │──┼─┼───│
       │ ●│●│ ○ │
       └──────────→ x₁

    Each cell contains one training point. The cell boundary is the
    set of points equidistant to two adjacent training points.

    K=1: extremely jagged boundary (every training point matters)
    K=5: smoother (5 training points vote, local noise averages out)
    K=n: predict the global majority class (completely smooth, maximum bias)
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Choosing K — The Bias-Variance Tradeoff:

    K = 1:     Memorises training set exactly — 0 training error
               High variance — boundary changes drastically with any new point
               Low bias — can represent any boundary shape

    K = n:     Always predicts the global majority class
               Zero variance — same prediction regardless of training set
               High bias — ignores all local structure

    K optimal: found by cross-validation
               Rule of thumb: start with K = sqrt(n), tune from there
               Odd values of K avoid ties in binary classification

### Part 2: Distance Metrics


### Why the Metric Matters:

"Close in feature space" depends entirely on what metric you use. Different metrics
create different neighbourhood shapes, which changes which training points are
selected as neighbours, which changes the prediction.

The choice of metric encodes domain knowledge about which differences between
feature values are meaningful.


### Common Distance Metrics:

**Euclidean Distance (L2):**
    d(x, z) = sqrt( Σⱼ (xⱼ − zⱼ)² )

    The standard straight-line distance in feature space.
    Sensitive to scale — features with large numerical range dominate.
    Assumes all features are equally important and on comparable scales.
    Use when: features are continuous and scaled similarly.

**Manhattan Distance (L1):**
    d(x, z) = Σⱼ |xⱼ − zⱼ|

    Sum of absolute differences along each axis.
    Less sensitive to outliers in individual features than Euclidean.
    Preferred when features have different scales or when outliers are common.
    Use when: high-dimensional data, or features represent independent counts.

**Minkowski Distance (Lp generalisation):**
    d(x, z) = ( Σⱼ |xⱼ − zⱼ|^p )^(1/p)

    p=1: Manhattan,  p=2: Euclidean,  p=∞: Chebyshev (max-axis distance)

**Cosine Similarity:**
    cos(x, z) = (x · z) / (||x|| · ||z||)

    Measures the angle between vectors, not their magnitude.
    Two vectors pointing in the same direction have similarity 1.
    Use when: magnitude is uninformative (document length, image brightness).
    Common in: text classification, recommender systems.

**Hamming Distance:**
    d(x, z) = fraction of positions where xⱼ ≠ zⱼ

    For categorical features — counts mismatches.
    Use when: features are categorical (one-hot encoded or integer-coded).


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 3 — L2 vs L1 Neighbourhoods (Unit Balls):**

    Which points count as "within distance 1" of the origin?

    L2 (Euclidean):             L1 (Manhattan):
    x₂ ↑                        x₂ ↑
    1  │  ·····                 1  │     *
       │ ·     ·                   │   *   *
    0  ├·       ·─→ x₁          0  ├*       *─→ x₁
       │ ·     ·                   │   *   *
   -1  │  ·····                -1  │     *

    L2: circular boundary (rotational symmetry)
    L1: diamond boundary (axis-aligned symmetry)
    L∞: square boundary

    The shape of the "unit ball" determines which points are neighbours.
    In high dimensions, L1 and cosine often outperform L2.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Importance of Feature Scaling:

Without scaling, KNN is dominated by the feature with the largest numerical range.

    Example:
        Feature 1: Age      (range 20–80)
        Feature 2: Income   (range 20,000–200,000)
        Feature 3: Children (range 0–5)

    Without scaling, Income differences of $10,000 completely swamp Age
    differences of 10 years — KNN essentially ignores Age and Children.

    With standardisation (z-score scaling):
        All features contribute equally to the Euclidean distance.

    Always scale features before applying KNN (StandardScaler).

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Rule: ALWAYS apply StandardScaler (or MinMaxScaler)        │
    │        before KNN. Without scaling, KNN is unreliable.      │
    │                                                             │
    │  Exception: if all features are naturally on the same scale │
    │  (e.g., image pixels 0–255, or normalised text features).   │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Part 3: The Curse of Dimensionality


### What Goes Wrong in High Dimensions?

KNN relies on the assumption that nearby points in feature space have similar labels.
In high dimensions, this assumption breaks down catastrophically — a phenomenon
known as the curse of dimensionality.

**Problem 1 — Distance concentration:**
In high dimensions, all points become approximately equidistant from any query point.
The ratio (max distance) / (min distance) → 1 as p → ∞.
When all points are equally far away, "nearest" neighbours are no longer meaningfully closer.

    Example: with p=1, a query point at 0.5 has neighbours at 0.4 and 0.6 (clearly close).
    With p=1000, almost all training points are roughly the same distance away.
    The "nearest" neighbours are only marginally closer than the "farthest" ones.

**Problem 2 — Data sparsity:**
The volume of a p-dimensional unit hypercube grows as 1^p = 1, but to cover
it with training points, we need exponentially more points.

    To have 10 neighbours within a region covering r fraction of each axis:
        n ≥ 10 / r^p

    For p=1, r=0.1: need n ≥ 100
    For p=10, r=0.1: need n ≥ 10^11   (infeasible)

The K nearest neighbours are not actually close — they might be drawn from
completely different parts of the feature space, providing no useful local signal.

**Problem 3 — Irrelevant features:**
Each irrelevant feature adds noise to the distance calculation, masking the signal
from relevant features. With 100 features but only 5 relevant ones, the distance
is mostly noise.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — The Curse of Dimensionality: Volume vs Edge Length:**

    To capture 10% of the data range in EACH dimension of a p-dim space,
    the edge length r of the hypercube needed grows as:

    n points in unit cube → need edge r such that r^p × n ≥ K neighbours

    p=1:  r = 0.10  (capture 10% of the range in 1D)
    p=2:  r = 0.32  (must expand to 32% in each direction)
    p=5:  r = 0.63  (must expand to 63% to still find neighbours)
    p=10: r = 0.79  (covers 79% of each feature range!)
    p=100: r ≈ 1.0  (must include almost entire feature space!)

    At p=100, "local neighbourhood" = "entire dataset" → KNN fails.

    MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    1. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) before applying KNN
    2. Feature selection — remove irrelevant features
    3. Use larger K (more neighbours) to compensate for sparsity
    4. Consider other models (trees, linear models) for p > 20–50
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =======================================================================================#

### Part 4: Approximate Nearest Neighbours — Scaling KNN


### The Computational Bottleneck:

Exact KNN prediction requires computing distances to all n training points: O(n·p).
For n=1,000,000 training examples and p=100 features, each prediction requires
100,000,000 multiplications. For real-time applications, this is prohibitive.

Three strategies scale KNN to large datasets:


### KD-Trees (for low dimensions):

A KD-tree is a binary tree that partitions the feature space along alternating axes.
Each node splits the data on one feature at the median value.

    Building:    O(n log n)  — sort and split recursively
    Query:       O(log n) average case   —  traverse the tree
                 O(n) worst case         —  pathological data distributions

    Works well for p ≤ 20. Degrades to O(n) for p > 20–30.
    This is the default in sklearn for p ≤ 30.


### Ball Trees:

Like KD-trees but partition space into nested hyperspheres (balls) rather than
axis-aligned rectangles. Can prune entire spheres when they're farther from the
query than the current K-th nearest neighbour.

    Building:    O(n log n)
    Query:       O(log n) average case
    Better than KD-trees for p > 20 and for non-Euclidean metrics.
    This is sklearn's default for p > 30.


### Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN):

For large n or large p, exact search is abandoned in favour of approximate
search that finds points within a guaranteed distance factor of the true nearest
neighbour, dramatically faster:

    FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):
        Uses product quantisation and inverted file index.
        Can search 1 billion vectors in milliseconds on GPU.
        Used for: image search, recommendation systems, semantic search.

    Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbours Oh Yeah):
        Random projection trees.
        Memory-mapped index — can query without loading into RAM.
        Used for: Spotify music recommendation.

    HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs):
        Graph-based: build a multi-layer proximity graph.
        State-of-the-art for ANN in many benchmarks.

### Part 5: KNN for Regression — Piecewise Local Averaging


### How KNN Regression Works:

KNN regression predicts the target for x_q as the (possibly weighted) mean of
the K nearest neighbours' target values. This creates a locally-adaptive
regression function — not a global parametric form.

Properties of KNN regression:
    - As K → 1: interpolates training data exactly (high variance)
    - As K → n: predicts the global mean of all targets (high bias)
    - As n → ∞, K → ∞, K/n → 0: converges to the true conditional mean E[y|x]
      (this is the theoretical guarantee — given infinite data, KNN is optimal)


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 5 — KNN Regression at Different K:**

    TRUE FUNCTION: y = sin(x) + noise     (smooth curve)

    K=1:                          K=5:                     K=20:

    Noisy/wiggly                    Good fit                 Underfit

    K=1 perfectly passes through each training point (overfit to noise)
    K=5 approximates the smooth function well
    K=20 over-smooths — begins to ignore local structure
    # =======================================================================================#

### Part 6: Advantages, Limitations, and When to Use KNN


### Advantages:

1. **Zero training time** — simply store the training data.
   Useful when training data updates frequently (no retraining needed).

2. **No model assumptions** — can represent any decision boundary.
   The decision boundary adapts perfectly to the data distribution.

3. **Naturally multi-class** — voting naturally handles any number of classes
   with no special modification (unlike SVM, which requires one-vs-rest).

4. **Interpretable predictions** — "These 5 similar patients all recovered,
   so you are likely to recover" is an intuitive and auditable explanation.

5. **Non-parametric** — no assumptions about the functional form of f(x).


### Limitations:

1. **Slow prediction** — O(n·p) per query with brute force.
   Not suitable for real-time prediction on large training sets.

2. **High memory** — stores the entire training set.
   For n=10M examples and p=100 features (float32), that's 4GB of RAM just for X.

3. **Curse of dimensionality** — performance degrades rapidly with p.
   Essentially fails for p > 50–100 without dimensionality reduction.

4. **Feature scaling required** — must standardise before applying KNN.

5. **No feature importance** — cannot tell you which features are relevant.
   All features contribute equally to the distance (unless you hand-weight them).

6. **Sensitive to irrelevant features** — each irrelevant feature adds noise
   to the distance, diluting the signal from relevant features.


### When KNN is the Right Choice:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Use KNN when:                                              │
    │    • Dataset is small to medium (n < 100k) and p is small   │
    │    • Decision boundary is highly irregular/non-parametric   │
    │    • Training data updates frequently (no retraining cost)  │
    │    • Interpretability ("here are your similar cases")       │
    │    • Quick baseline for comparison                          │
    │    • Recommendation systems (collaborative filtering)       │
    │                                                             │
    │  Avoid KNN when:                                            │
    │    • n is large (> 100k) — use tree-based or linear models  │
    │    • p is large (> 50) — curse of dimensionality            │
    │    • Features have very different scales (must scale first) │
    │    • Real-time prediction is needed (O(n·p) per query)      │
    │    • Features are categorical (use decision trees instead)  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


### KNN in the Full Series Context:

KNN is in many ways the opposite of every other model:

    All other models:  parameterised, generalise beyond training data, fast to predict
    KNN:               non-parametric, memorises training data, slow to predict

The lesson KNN teaches is that the local structure of the data is fundamentally
the information we want to exploit. Every other algorithm tries to capture this
structure in a compressed parametric form. KNN skips the compression entirely —
and in doing so reveals exactly what is lost and what is gained by that choice.

  1.  KNN stores all training data — O(1) train time, O(n·p) prediction time
  2.  Inductive bias: nearby points in feature space have similar labels
  3.  Always apply StandardScaler before KNN (distance is scale-sensitive)
  4.  K=1: perfectly memorises train set (0 train error, high variance)
  5.  Optimal K found by cross-validation (not by looking at train accuracy)
  6.  Distance weighting (1/d) usually outperforms uniform voting for large K
  7.  Curse of dimensionality: KNN fails for p > 20–50 without PCA
  8.  KD-tree/Ball tree reduce prediction cost from O(n·p) to O(p·log n)
  9.  For n > 1M: use FAISS or HNSW (approximate nearest neighbours)
  10. Collaborative filtering (Spotify, Amazon) = KNN in user/item space
  11. KNN is the only model in the series that makes no parameter assumptions
  12. Interpretable: "here are your 5 most similar training examples"
