Naive Bayes — Probabilistic Classification via Bayes' Theorem
=============================================================

Naive Bayes is the oldest and simplest probabilistic classifier. It applies
Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each class given the
observed features, and predicts the class with the highest posterior.

The "naive" in Naive Bayes refers to the conditional independence assumption:
given the class label, all features are assumed to be independent of each other.
This assumption is almost never literally true — yet Naive Bayes works remarkably
well in practice, especially for text classification, spam filtering, and medical
diagnosis, often outperforming far more complex models when data is scarce.

It is the only model in this series derived from pure probability theory rather
than from optimisation. Understanding it requires understanding Bayes' theorem,
which is one of the most important results in all of statistics.

### What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that uses Bayes' theorem to compute,
for each class c, the probability that an input x belongs to that class:

                    P(C=c | x) ∝ P(C=c) · Π_j P(xⱼ | C=c)

It then predicts the class with the highest posterior probability.

The "naive" assumption is that all features x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ are conditionally
independent given the class label C. This means:

                    P(x | C=c) = P(x₁ | C=c) · P(x₂ | C=c) · ... · P(xₚ | C=c)

In reality, features are almost never truly independent — the words "New" and
"York" in a document are not independent. Yet Naive Bayes works astonishingly
well precisely because even a wrong independence assumption produces surprisingly
accurate posterior class rankings (though not accurate probabilities).

Think of it like a doctor making a diagnosis. A naive Bayes doctor would assess
each symptom — fever, cough, fatigue — independently, compute the probability
of each symptom given each disease, and combine them multiplicatively. A more
sophisticated doctor would consider interactions between symptoms. The naive
doctor is less accurate but makes decisions very fast with very little data.

    Things that exist inside the model (learned during training):
        - P(C=c):          class prior — fraction of training examples per class
        - P(xⱼ | C=c):    feature likelihoods — one distribution per feature per class

    Things you control before training (hyperparameters):
        - var_smoothing:   Gaussian NB regularisation (prevents zero-variance)
        - alpha:           Laplace smoothing for Multinomial/Bernoulli NB
        - The model variant: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli, Complement


### Naive Bayes as Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM)

Naive Bayes is not derived from ERM — it is derived from probability theory.
It minimises 0-1 loss only when the independence assumption holds exactly.
We can still place it in the ERM template for comparison:

and averaging (MLE). This makes Naive Bayes the fastest-training model
in this entire series: a single pass over the data is sufficient.

    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Unlike all other models which learn a discriminative boundary (directly modelling
P(C|x)), Naive Bayes learns a generative model (modelling P(x,C) = P(x|C)·P(C)).
It can in principle generate new data samples, not just classify.

---

### Part 1: Bayes' Theorem


### The Foundation:

Bayes' theorem is a rule for updating beliefs in light of evidence:

                    P(C | x) = P(x | C) · P(C) / P(x)

    P(C | x):   POSTERIOR — probability of class C given evidence x
    P(x | C):   LIKELIHOOD — probability of observing x given class C
    P(C)    :   PRIOR — probability of class C before seeing x
    P(x)    :   EVIDENCE — normalising constant (same for all classes)


### Why We Can Ignore P(x):

For classification, we compare P(C=c | x) across classes. Since P(x) is the
same for all classes, we can drop it and work with the unnormalised posterior:

                    P(C=c | x) ∝ P(x | C=c) · P(C=c)

We predict the class with the highest posterior (the MAP decision):

                    ŷ = argmax_c  P(C=c) · P(x | C=c)


### Concrete Example — Spam Filtering:

    Email arrives containing the word "FREE". Is it spam or not?

    Prior probabilities (from historical data):
        P(spam) = 0.3     (30% of all emails are spam)
        P(not_spam) = 0.7

    Likelihood of seeing "FREE" in each class:
        P("FREE" | spam)     = 0.8   (80% of spam emails contain "FREE")
        P("FREE" | not_spam) = 0.1   (10% of normal emails contain "FREE")

    Posterior:
        P(spam | "FREE")     ∝ 0.3 × 0.8 = 0.24
        P(not_spam | "FREE") ∝ 0.7 × 0.1 = 0.07

    Normalised:
        P(spam | "FREE")     = 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.07) = 0.774
        P(not_spam | "FREE") = 0.07 / (0.24 + 0.07) = 0.226

    Decision: spam (77.4% posterior probability)

    Now add a second word: "Meeting"
        P("Meeting" | spam)     = 0.1
        P("Meeting" | not_spam) = 0.4

    Naive Bayes assumes independence: multiply the likelihoods:
        P(spam | "FREE", "Meeting")     ∝ 0.3 × 0.8 × 0.1 = 0.024
        P(not_spam | "FREE", "Meeting") ∝ 0.7 × 0.1 × 0.4 = 0.028

    Decision: NOT spam (despite "FREE", the word "Meeting" flips it)


    # ======================================================================================= # 
    **Diagram 1 — Bayes' Theorem: Prior → Likelihood → Posterior:**

    PRIOR: before seeing any features        POSTERIOR: after observing "FREE"
    ─────────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────
    Spam     [███    ] 30%                   Spam     [███████   ] 77%
    Not Spam [███████] 70%                   Not Spam [██        ] 23%

    The evidence "FREE" (8× more common in spam than normal email) shifts
    the posterior strongly toward spam.

    Add "Meeting" (4× more common in normal):
    Spam     [████████] 46%    ← nearly back to 50/50 (meeting moderates it)
    Not Spam [████████] 54%

    Each feature (word) updates our belief multiplicatively.
    # ======================================================================================= # 


### Log-Space Computation:

In practice, multiplying many probabilities underflows to zero for long documents.
We work in log space — multiplications become additions:

    log P(C=c | x) ∝ log P(C=c) + Σⱼ log P(xⱼ | C=c)

This is numerically stable even for thousands of features.


---


### Part 2: Three Variants of Naive Bayes


### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) — Continuous Features:

Assumes each feature xⱼ follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution within each class:

                    P(xⱼ | C=c) = N(xⱼ; μⱼ_c, σ²ⱼ_c)

Training: estimate μⱼ_c (class-conditional mean) and σ²ⱼ_c (variance) from data.
No gradient descent — just compute means and variances.

    P(xⱼ | C=c) = (1 / √(2πσ²ⱼ_c)) · exp(−(xⱼ − μⱼ_c)² / (2σ²ⱼ_c))

Use when: features are continuous (measurements, sensor readings, biomarkers).


### Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) — Count Features:

Assumes features are counts (e.g., word frequencies in a document):

                    P(x | C=c) = (Σⱼ xⱼ)! / (Πⱼ xⱼ!) · Πⱼ θⱼ_c^xⱼ

Where θⱼ_c = P(feature j | class c) is the probability of feature j in class c.

Training: estimate θⱼ_c by counting occurrences with Laplace smoothing:

                    θⱼ_c = (count(j, c) + α) / (count(c) + α · p)

Where α is the Laplace smoothing parameter (α=1 = add-one smoothing).

Use when: features are integer counts (word counts, n-gram frequencies).


### Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) — Binary Features:

Assumes each feature is binary: xⱼ ∈ {0, 1} (feature j present or absent):

                    P(xⱼ | C=c) = θⱼ_c^xⱼ · (1 − θⱼ_c)^(1−xⱼ)

Unlike MNB, BNB explicitly models the ABSENCE of features. A word NOT appearing
in a spam email is evidence of non-spam — BNB captures this, MNB ignores it.

Use when: features are presence/absence indicators (document classification
with binary bag-of-words, or any binary feature vector).


    # ======================================================================================= # 
    **Diagram 2 — When to Use Which Variant:**

    Feature type                 → Recommended Naive Bayes variant
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Continuous (height, temp.)   → Gaussian NB
    Word counts in document      → Multinomial NB  (most common for NLP)
    Word present/absent (0/1)    → Bernoulli NB
    Mixed continuous + binary    → Custom: stack GNB + BNB predictions
    Categorical (not ordinal)    → CategoricalNB  (sklearn)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Key difference: MNB vs BNB for text
    MNB: "FREE appeared 3 times → very strong spam signal"
    BNB: "FREE appeared (present=1) → spam signal"
         "Meeting absent (present=0) → spam signal"
    BNB explicitly penalises for the absence of non-spam words.
    # ======================================================================================= # 


### Laplace Smoothing — Handling Unseen Features:

Without smoothing, if a word never appeared in training spam emails, then
P("newword" | spam) = 0, and the entire product becomes zero:

    P(spam | "FREE", "newword") ∝ 0.8 × 0 = 0   (even with strong spam signal!)

This is the zero-frequency problem. Laplace smoothing adds a pseudocount of α
to every feature, ensuring no probability is exactly zero:

    θⱼ_c = (count(j, c) + α) / (count(c) + α · p)

    α = 0: no smoothing (zero-frequency problem)
    α = 1: add-one (Laplace) smoothing — most common
    α > 1: heavier smoothing — more regularisation

---

### Part 3: Why the Naive Assumption Works in Practice


### The Miracle of Wrong Assumptions:

The conditional independence assumption is almost always violated in practice:
    - In text, "New" and "York" co-occur far more than independence implies
    - Medical features (blood pressure and cholesterol) are correlated
    - Pixel values in images are heavily spatially correlated

Yet Naive Bayes still works well. Why?

**Reason 1 — Ranking vs calibration:**
For classification, we only need to get the RANKING of class posteriors right,
not their exact values. The independence assumption can distort the probabilities
significantly while still ranking the correct class highest.

**Reason 2 — High-dimensional sparsity:**
In text classification with 50,000 word features, most features are 0 for any
given document. The few non-zero features are approximately independent in practice
(a document about "spam email" doesn't automatically also contain "mortgage").

**Reason 3 — Low data regime:**
Estimating P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ | c) jointly requires exponential data.
Estimating P(xⱼ | c) independently requires only linear data.
When data is scarce, the independence assumption is a form of regularisation.


### The Log-Odds Form — Naive Bayes is a Linear Classifier:

For binary classification, taking the log of the posterior ratio:

    log(P(C=1|x) / P(C=0|x)) = log(P(C=1)/P(C=0)) + Σⱼ log(P(xⱼ|C=1)/P(xⱼ|C=0))

This is a linear function of the log-likelihoods! For Gaussian features:

    = log(P(C=1)/P(C=0)) + Σⱼ [log N(xⱼ; μⱼ₁, σⱼ₁²) − log N(xⱼ; μⱼ₀, σⱼ₀²)]

If all class-conditional variances are equal (σⱼ₁² = σⱼ₀²):
    The squared terms cancel → decision boundary is LINEAR in x
    (This is Linear Discriminant Analysis / LDA)

If variances differ between classes:
    Quadratic terms remain → decision boundary is QUADRATIC in x
    (This is Quadratic Discriminant Analysis / QDA)

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  GNB with equal class variances = LDA (Linear boundary)     │
    │  GNB with unequal class variances = QDA (Quadratic)         │
    │  Multinomial NB = Linear classifier in log-count space      │
    │  Bernoulli NB = Linear classifier in binary feature space   │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Naive Bayes is a linear classifier in disguise (for most variants and conditions).
This explains why it competes well with Logistic Regression — they are both
fitting linear decision boundaries, but via different mechanisms:
    LR: discriminative — directly optimises P(C|x) via BCE loss
    NB: generative — models P(x|C) · P(C) and applies Bayes' theorem


---


### Part 4: Naive Bayes for Text Classification


### The Bag-of-Words Representation:

Text is converted to a feature vector by representing each document as a count
(or presence/absence) of each word in the vocabulary:

    Vocabulary: {spam, free, offer, meeting, report, urgent}
    Document: "Free urgent offer"
    Feature vector: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]   ← bag-of-words (binary)
    Count vector:   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]   ← same here (each word once)
    Document: "Free free spam spam spam"
    Count vector:   [3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]   ← Multinomial NB uses these counts

         │
         └── Prediction: log P(spam) + Σ log P(wordᵢ | spam)
                         vs log P(not_spam) + Σ log P(wordᵢ | not_spam)
                         → predict class with higher log-posterior
                         
    # ======================================================================================= # 


### Why Naive Bayes Dominates Text Classification:

1. **Fast training**: one pass over the data to count word frequencies
2. **Fast prediction**: sum of pre-computed log-probabilities
3. **Memory efficient**: store only (vocab_size × n_classes) parameters
4. **Handles high dimensionality naturally**: vocab can be 100k+ words
5. **Strong baseline**: often competitive with deep learning on short texts


---


### Part 5: Advantages, Limitations, and Comparisons


### Advantages:

1. **Extremely fast training** — O(n·p) single pass over data. No iterations.
   For n=1M examples, p=100k words, training takes seconds.

2. **Works well with very little data** — the independence assumption acts
   as implicit regularisation. Logistic Regression needs far more data.

3. **Naturally handles missing features** — skip missing features in the product.
   Other models require imputation; NB simply omits that factor.

4. **Probabilistic output** — returns calibrated P(C=c|x) directly.
   (Note: these probabilities are often over-confident due to the naive assumption.)

5. **Handles multi-class natively** — compute posteriors for all classes,
   predict the argmax. No one-vs-rest modification needed.

6. **Online/streaming learning** — can update counts incrementally as new
   data arrives. Ideal for data streams without storing the full dataset.


### Limitations:

1. **Conditional independence assumption** — rarely true in practice. This can
   make probability estimates unreliable (overconfident) even when classification
   accuracy is high.

2. **Zero-frequency problem** — a feature-class combination not seen in training
   gives zero probability. Requires Laplace smoothing.

3. **Poor probability calibration** — the naive assumption causes posteriors
   to cluster near 0 and 1 rather than being well-spread. Use Platt scaling or
   isotonic regression to calibrate if probabilities matter.

4. **Can't model feature interactions** — "New York" is one concept, but NB
   treats "New" and "York" as independent. Decision trees naturally capture
   interactions; NB cannot.


### Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression — The Generative/Discriminative Pair:

These two are deeply connected. Both produce linear decision boundaries for most
common setups. The difference is in how they are estimated:

    │  Speed:           extremely fast        slower                       │
    │  Low data:        better (regularised)  worse (overfits)             │
    │  Enough data:     worse (wrong model)   better (learns true boundary)│
    │  Calibration:     poor (overconfident)  good (well calibrated)       │
    │  Correlated feats: worse               handles better                │
    │  Extrapolation:   generative (can)      discriminative (cannot)      │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The key insight: as training data grows to infinity, Logistic Regression
converges to the true P(C|x), while Naive Bayes converges to the NB model
(which is only the true P(C|x) when the independence assumption holds).

With limited data, NB is often better because it wastes fewer parameters.
With abundant data, LR is usually better because it learns the true boundary.
