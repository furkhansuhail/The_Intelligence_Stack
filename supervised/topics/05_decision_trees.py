Decision Trees — Learning by Asking Questions
==============================================

A decision tree learns a sequence of yes/no questions about the input features
and uses the answers to arrive at a prediction. It is the only model in this
series that makes no linearity assumption whatsoever — it can represent any
decision boundary composed of axis-aligned cuts, and it does so through a
process that mirrors how humans actually reason about classification problems.

Decision trees are also the building block for Random Forests and Gradient
Boosted Trees — two of the most powerful and widely deployed algorithms in
all of applied machine learning.

### What is a Decision Tree?

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a hierarchy of
if/else questions about input features and uses the answers to make predictions.
Unlike every model studied so far — linear regression, logistic regression, SVM —
a decision tree makes no linearity assumption. Its decision boundaries are composed
entirely of axis-aligned splits, which can approximate any shape given sufficient
depth.

The analogy is a game of 20 Questions. Each internal node of the tree asks one
question about one feature ("Is age > 40?", "Is income > 50k?"). The answer routes
the example left or right. The leaf at the bottom gives the prediction — either a
class label (classification) or a numeric value (regression).

What makes decision trees remarkable is their interpretability. Unlike a neural
network or SVM, you can read out the learned rules in plain English. A doctor can
follow the chain of questions and understand exactly why a diagnosis was made.

    Things that exist inside the model (learned during training):
        - The tree structure          — which feature to split at each node
        - The split thresholds        — the cutoff value for each split
        - The leaf predictions        — class label or mean value at each leaf

    Things you control before training (hyperparameters):
        - max_depth                   — maximum depth of the tree
        - min_samples_split           — minimum examples required to split a node
        - min_samples_leaf            — minimum examples required in a leaf
        - criterion                   — impurity measure: "gini" or "entropy"


### Decision Trees as Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM)

Decision trees fit the ERM framework, though with an important caveat:

The critical difference from all previous models: tree learning is GREEDY.
At each node we find the locally best split without backtracking. This means
we are not guaranteed to find the globally optimal tree — but the greedy
solution is fast and works well in practice.

Comparing ERM formulations across the series:
    Linear Regression:    MSE loss,       gradient descent (global optimum)
    Logistic Regression:  BCE loss,       gradient descent (global optimum)
    SVM:                  Hinge loss,     quadratic programming (global optimum)
    Decision Tree:        Gini / Entropy, greedy splitting (local, not global)

This contrasts sharply with the linear models:
    Linear/Logistic/SVM:  f(x) = w·x + b — features contribute ADDITIVELY
    Decision Tree:        f(x) = look up the region x falls into — features
                          contribute CONDITIONALLY (each split depends on
                          which branch was taken above it)


---


### Part 1: The Splitting Criterion — How to Choose the Best Question


The central challenge in training a decision tree is: at each node, which feature
and which threshold produces the most informative split? We measure this using
an impurity function.


### What is Impurity?

Impurity quantifies how mixed the class labels are in a set of examples. A perfectly
pure node contains only examples of one class (impurity = 0). A maximally impure node
has equal numbers of every class (impurity is maximum).

A good split takes an impure parent node and produces children that are more pure
than the parent. The reduction in impurity is the "gain" from that split.


### Gini Impurity:

For a node containing examples from k classes with proportions p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ:

                    Gini = 1 − Σⱼ pⱼ²

Intuition: if you randomly pick two examples from the node, Gini measures the
probability that they belong to different classes. Zero means all examples are the
same class (pure). Maximum is (1 − 1/k) when all classes are equally represented.

For binary classification (k=2, proportions p and 1−p):

                    Gini = 1 − p² − (1−p)² = 2p(1−p)

This is maximised at p = 0.5 (equal mix) and is 0 at p = 0 or p = 1 (pure).


### Entropy (Information Gain):

From information theory (Shannon, 1948), entropy measures the average number of bits
needed to encode a randomly drawn label from the node:

                    H = − Σⱼ pⱼ log₂(pⱼ)       (convention: 0 · log 0 = 0)

For binary classification:

                    H = −p log₂(p) − (1−p) log₂(1−p)

Entropy is maximised at p = 0.5 (H = 1 bit) and is 0 at p = 0 or p = 1 (pure).
Information Gain is the reduction in entropy from a split:

                    IG = H(parent) − Σ_children  |child|/|parent| · H(child)

    Key values (binary classification):
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    p     Gini = 2p(1-p)   Entropy = -p·log₂p - (1-p)·log₂(1-p)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0.0   0.000            0.000   (pure: only class 0)
    0.1   0.180            0.469
    0.2   0.320            0.722
    0.3   0.420            0.881
    0.5   0.500            1.000   (maximally impure)

    1.0   0.000            0.000   (pure: only class 1)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Both peak at p=0.5 and vanish at p=0 or p=1.
    Entropy is slightly more sensitive to near-pure nodes.
    In practice, both produce very similar trees.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Finding the Best Split:

For each candidate split (feature f, threshold t), we compute the weighted impurity
of the resulting children:

    Impurity_split = (|left|/|parent|) · Impurity(left)
                   + (|right|/|parent|) · Impurity(right)

    Gain = Impurity(parent) − Impurity_split

The best split is the one with the largest Gain (equivalently, the smallest
weighted child impurity).

For a dataset with n examples and p features, finding the best split requires
checking O(n·p) candidates (one threshold per unique feature value, per feature).


### Concrete Calculation:

Let's manually compute the best split for a small dataset.

    Dataset (n=10, predicting if customer buys):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Age    Income    Buys?
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    25     Low       No
    30     High      Yes
    35     High      Yes
    40     Low       No
    45     High      Yes
    50     High      Yes
    55     Low       No
    60     High      Yes
    65     Low       No
    70     High      Yes
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Parent node: 6 Yes, 4 No  →  p = 0.6
    Gini(parent) = 1 − 0.6² − 0.4² = 1 − 0.36 − 0.16 = 0.48

    Candidate Split 1: Age ≤ 42
        Left  (Age ≤ 42): [No, Yes, Yes, No, Yes]  → 3 Yes, 2 No  → p=0.6
            Gini(left)  = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48
        Right (Age > 42): [Yes, Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes] → 4 Yes, 2 No → p=0.67
            Gini(right) = 2(0.67)(0.33) = 0.44
        Weighted Gini = (5/10)(0.48) + (5/10)(0.44) = 0.46
        Gain = 0.48 − 0.46 = 0.02   ← small gain

    Candidate Split 2: Income = High
        Left  (Income = High): [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes]  → 6 Yes, 0 No → p=1.0
            Gini(left)  = 0.0  (PURE!)
        Right (Income = Low):  [No, No, No, No]                → 0 Yes, 4 No → p=0.0
            Gini(right) = 0.0  (PURE!)
        Weighted Gini = 0
        Gain = 0.48 − 0.00 = 0.48   ← maximum possible gain!

    Decision: Split on Income = High  (perfectly separates the classes)


---


### Part 2: The CART Algorithm — Growing the Tree


### Recursive Binary Splitting:

The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm grows a tree by:

    1. Starting with all training examples at the root
    2. Finding the best split (feature + threshold maximising the gain)
    3. Partitioning examples into left and right child nodes
    4. Recursively repeating steps 2–3 on each child
    5. Stopping when a stopping criterion is met (node is pure, depth limit
       reached, or too few examples to split)

The result is a binary tree where each internal node tests one feature against
one threshold, and each leaf holds a prediction.


    # =======================================================================================#

                                                   Predict ●        Predict ○


    GROWING STOPS WHEN ANY OF THESE IS TRUE:

    Condition                    Effect
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Node is pure (Gini = 0)      Leaf: predict the single remaining class
    max_depth reached            Leaf: predict majority class
    Fewer examples than          Leaf: can't split further
      min_samples_split
    Best split gives zero gain   Leaf: no useful information in any split
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Making Predictions:

Once the tree is built, predictions are made by routing a new example from the root
downward, following the branch that matches each split condition, until reaching a leaf.

    For classification: predict the majority class in the leaf
    For regression: predict the mean target value in the leaf

Runtime complexity: O(depth) per prediction — extremely fast at inference time,
regardless of how large the training set was.


### Regression Trees:

Decision trees handle regression (continuous outputs) by replacing the impurity
criterion with variance reduction:

                Variance(node) = (1/n) Σ (yᵢ − ȳ)²

The best split is the one that maximises the reduction in total weighted variance.
Each leaf predicts the mean y of the training examples that fall there.


---


### Part 3: Overfitting and Pruning


### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff for Trees:

An unconstrained decision tree will grow until every leaf contains exactly one
training example — perfectly classifying all training data (training error = 0) but
generalising poorly to new data (high variance).

    Shallow tree (depth 1–3):
        High bias  — may not capture the true pattern
        Low variance — predictions stable across different training sets

    Deep tree (depth = n):
        Low bias  — memorises training data perfectly
        High variance — tiny changes in training data → very different trees

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 3 — Depth vs Training/Test Error:**

    Error
    ↑
    │╲ Training error
    │  ╲
    │    ╲____
    │         ‾‾‾─────────────────────── → 0 (perfect training fit)
    │
    │         ___
    │       ╱     ╲
    │     ╱         ╲_____
    │   ╱                  ‾‾‾──────────  Test error (U-curve)
    │                       ↑
    │                 optimal depth
    └──────────────────────────────────→ Tree depth

    Training error monotonically decreases as depth grows.
    Test error is U-shaped — there is a sweet spot.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping):

Stop growing the tree early by imposing constraints:

    max_depth:          Maximum depth from root to any leaf.
                        Simplest and most interpretable control.

    min_samples_split:  A node must have at least this many examples to be split.
                        Prevents splitting tiny subsets (likely noise).

    min_samples_leaf:   Each leaf must contain at least this many examples.
                        Ensures each prediction is based on enough data.

    min_impurity_decrease: Only split if the gain exceeds this threshold.
                        Ignores splits that contribute almost nothing.


### Post-Pruning (Cost-Complexity Pruning):

Grow the full tree first, then remove subtrees that don't sufficiently reduce error.

The cost-complexity criterion adds a penalty for tree size:

                    Rα(T) = R(T) + α · |T|

Where R(T) is the training error of tree T, |T| is the number of leaves, and α is
a penalty per leaf (higher α → simpler tree).

For each α value, there is a unique optimal pruned tree. As α increases from 0 to ∞,
the sequence of optimal trees goes from the full tree down to just the root.
The optimal α is found by cross-validation.

sklearn implements this as `ccp_alpha` (cost-complexity pruning alpha).


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — Pruning: Removing a Subtree:**

    BEFORE PRUNING:                        AFTER PRUNING:
    (two leaves with near-identical        (subtree replaced by single leaf)
     class distributions)

         [Feature A ≤ 5?]                      [Feature A ≤ 5?]
          ╱           ╲                          ╱           ╲
    [Feat B ≤ 2?]    [Predict ○]          [Feat B ≤ 2?]    [Predict ○]
      ╱       ╲                    ──►      ╱       ╲
    [●: 8, ○: 2] [●: 7, ○: 3]           [Predict ●]    ← merged leaf
    (80% ●)      (70% ●)

    The subtree [Feat B ≤ 2?] splits into two leaves that both predict ●.
    This split is contributing almost nothing — prune it away.
    # =======================================================================================# 


---


### Part 4: Feature Importance


### Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI):

The most common importance measure: for each feature, sum the impurity reduction
it causes across all splits in the tree, weighted by the number of examples passing
through each split:

    Importance(feature f) = Σ_{nodes where f is used}  (|node|/n) · Gain(node)

Features that produce large gains early in the tree (closer to the root, affecting
more examples) receive higher importance scores. Importances are normalised to sum to 1.

**Caveat:** MDI is biased toward high-cardinality features (features with many unique
values have more thresholds to try, so more chances to get a high gain by chance).
For unbiased importance, use permutation importance (sklearn's permutation_importance).


### What Feature Importance Tells You — and What It Doesn't:

    Feature importance DOES tell you:
        Which features the tree uses most for splitting
        Relative influence of features on the training data

    Feature importance DOES NOT tell you:
        Direction of the relationship (does feature X increase or decrease prediction?)
        Whether the feature is causally important
        Whether the importance is stable (try permutation importance for robustness)


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 5 — Feature Importance: High vs Low:**

    HIGH IMPORTANCE (feature used at root and high nodes):

    depth 0:     [Feature A ≤ 5?]          ← splits 100% of data, large gain
                  ╱             ╲
    depth 1: [Feat B ≤ 2?]   [Feat C ≤ 7?] ← splits 50% each, moderate gain
              ╱       ╲         ╱     ╲
    depth 2: ... leaves ...  ... leaves ...

    Feature A importance ≈ (100/100) × 0.4 = 0.40
    Feature B importance ≈ (50/100)  × 0.2 = 0.10
    Feature C importance ≈ (50/100)  × 0.2 = 0.10

    A low-depth feature affecting many examples gets much higher importance
    than an equally discriminative feature used only in small leaf subtrees.

### Part 5: Decision Tree for Regression


Decision tree regression works identically to classification but uses:
    Splitting criterion: Variance reduction instead of Gini/Entropy
    Leaf prediction:    Mean of target values in that leaf (not majority class)

The resulting model is a step function — piecewise constant over input space.

                    Variance(node) = (1/n) Σ (yᵢ − ȳ)²

Best split = the (feature, threshold) pair that maximises:

    Variance_reduction = Variance(parent) − (|left|/n) · Var(left)
                                          − (|right|/n) · Var(right)

### Part 6: Advantages, Limitations, and the Path to Ensembles


### Advantages of Decision Trees:

1. Interpretability — you can literally read the learned rules in English.
   No other model we've studied matches this. A doctor can audit every decision.

2. No feature scaling required — splits are threshold comparisons, not dot products.
   Standardising or normalising features changes nothing.

3. Handles mixed feature types natively — categorical and numerical features can
   sit side by side with no preprocessing.

4. Naturally handles non-linear interactions — a split at depth 2 already represents
   a feature interaction (the split condition depends on which branch you took above).

5. Fast inference — O(depth) predictions, even for millions of features.


### Limitations of Decision Trees:

1. High variance (instability) — small changes in training data can produce
   completely different trees. This is the single biggest weakness.

2. Greedy splits are not globally optimal — a locally suboptimal split early in the
   tree may prevent better splits later. No backtracking.

3. Axis-aligned boundaries — smooth diagonal decision boundaries require many splits.
   A linear boundary y = x₁ + x₂ that logistic regression fits perfectly in one
   step requires many axis-aligned steps in a decision tree.

4. Bias toward high-cardinality features — MDI importance is inflated for features
   with many unique values.

5. Poor extrapolation — regression trees can only predict values within the range of
   training targets. They cannot extrapolate beyond what they've seen.


### The Bridge to Ensembles:

The high variance of decision trees motivated the two most important ensemble methods
in applied machine learning:

    Random Forests (Breiman, 2001):
        Train many trees, each on a random subset of features and data.
        Average their predictions (classification: majority vote).
        Averaging reduces variance while keeping low bias.
        The randomness decorrelates the trees — each tree makes different errors.

    Gradient Boosted Trees (Friedman, 2001):
        Train trees sequentially, each correcting the errors of the previous.
        Each tree is a shallow learner (weak learner).
        Boosting reduces bias while controlling variance via learning rate.
        XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost are all this idea at scale.

  A common question: do decision tree importances agree with logistic
  regression coefficients about which features matter?

  They measure different things:
    DT importance:   how much a feature reduces impurity across the tree
    LR coefficient:  the additive contribution of a unit increase in a feature
                     to the log-odds (assuming linearity)

  When the relationship is linear: they should roughly agree.
  When the relationship is non-linear: they may disagree significantly.

  Where they agree (✓): the feature has both high tree importance and
    a large logistic regression coefficient — it's genuinely predictive.

  Where they disagree (~): the feature is important to the tree
    (non-linear relationship it can capture) but weak in LR
    (the linear assumption doesn't hold for that feature).

  Advice:
    • If LR and DT agree: high confidence the feature is truly important
    • If only DT marks it important: the feature may have non-linear effects
    • If only LR marks it important: the feature may have linear effects that
      the tree didn't isolate (e.g., masked by correlated features)

  3. Decision boundaries are axis-aligned step functions — no linearity assumed
  4. Unconstrained trees memorise training data (zero train error, high test error)
  5. max_depth and min_samples_leaf are the key regularisation hyperparameters
  6. Feature importance = impurity gain × fraction of samples, summed over nodes
  7. Trees have high variance — small data changes → different structure
  8. Random Forests fix this: average many diverse trees (next module)
  9. Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially to correct residual errors
