Ensemble Methods — Wisdom of Crowds in Machine Learning
========================================================

Ensemble methods are a family of meta-learning strategies that combine multiple
"weak" or "base" learners to produce a single, stronger predictor. The core
intuition is simple: many models that each make different mistakes can, when
aggregated, cancel out individual errors and produce dramatically better
generalisation than any single model alone.

This module covers Bagging, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting,
and Stacking — the full ensemble toolkit.

## 04 · Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods answer a deceptively simple question: if one model is good,
can many models be better? The answer is yes — but only if those models make
**different** errors. Diversity is the engine of ensemble learning.

### What is an Ensemble Method?

An ensemble is a combination of multiple models (called base learners or weak
learners) whose individual predictions are aggregated into a single final
prediction. The aggregation may be averaging, majority voting, or a learned
combination.

The three canonical strategies are:

    Bagging:    train base learners INDEPENDENTLY on random subsets of data,
                then AVERAGE or VOTE on predictions.
                Goal: reduce variance.

    Boosting:   train base learners SEQUENTIALLY, each one correcting the
                errors of the previous. Weight the ensemble by learner quality.
                Goal: reduce bias (and variance).

    Stacking:   train base learners independently, then train a meta-learner
                on their predictions as features.
                Goal: learn the optimal combination of base learner outputs.

    Things that exist inside the model (learnable parameters):
        - Base learner parameters   — weights, splits, coefficients of each tree/model
        - Ensemble weights          — αₘ in Boosting, meta-model weights in Stacking
        - Sample weights (Boosting) — wᵢ, emphasising misclassified examples

    Things that exist only at setup time (hyperparameters):
        - n_estimators   — number of base learners
        - max_depth      — depth of each base tree (controls complexity)
        - learning_rate  — step size for boosting updates
        - max_features   — feature subsetting (Random Forest)
        - subsample      — row subsetting (Gradient Boosting)

### Part 1: The Bias–Variance Decomposition — Why Ensembles Work

The expected test error of any predictor F decomposes as:

    E[(y − F(x))²]  =  Bias²[F(x)]  +  Var[F(x)]  +  σ²(noise)
                        ↑               ↑               ↑
                        systematic      sensitivity     irreducible
                        error           to training     noise
                                        data

This decomposition reveals the fundamental tradeoff:

    High-bias models (underfitting): simple, too rigid, systematically wrong.
        Lowering bias usually raises variance.

    High-variance models (overfitting): complex, sensitive to training noise.
        Lowering variance usually raises bias.

Ensemble methods attack specific parts of this tradeoff:

    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    BAGGING:   starts with high-variance, low-bias model → reduces variance
    BOOSTING:  starts with high-bias, low-variance model → reduces bias

    This is the fundamental difference between the two paradigms.
    # =======================================================================================# 

### Variance Reduction by Averaging (Why Bagging Works):

If M models each have variance σ² and are perfectly uncorrelated:

                    Var[average] = σ² / M

With M = 100 trees, variance drops to 1/100 of a single tree's variance.
In practice, trees are correlated (same training data), so the reduction is:

                    Var[average] = ρσ² + (1-ρ)σ²/M

Where ρ is the average pairwise correlation between trees. As M → ∞:

                    Var[average] → ρσ²   (irreducible floor)

This is why Random Forest adds feature randomness: it reduces ρ, pushing
the floor lower. More diverse trees → lower residual variance.

### Part 2: Bagging — Bootstrap Aggregating

Bagging (Breiman, 1996) creates an ensemble by training each base learner
on a different bootstrap sample of the training data.

A bootstrap sample of size n is drawn WITH REPLACEMENT from the training set:
    - ~63.2% of original examples appear at least once
    - ~36.8% are NOT sampled (called out-of-bag, or OOB, examples)
    - Some examples appear 2, 3, or more times

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 2 — The Bagging Process:**

    TRAINING DATA: [x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅, x₆, x₇, x₈]

    Bootstrap 1: [x₂, x₁, x₅, x₂, x₈, x₃, x₁, x₆]  → Train Tree 1
    Bootstrap 2: [x₄, x₇, x₃, x₄, x₁, x₆, x₂, x₄]  → Train Tree 2
    Bootstrap 3: [x₁, x₃, x₈, x₅, x₇, x₃, x₆, x₂]  → Train Tree 3
          ⋮
    Bootstrap M: [x₃, x₆, x₄, x₇, x₁, x₅, x₈, x₄]  → Train Tree M

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    PREDICTION (new x):
        Tree 1 → ŷ₁ = 0.72
        Tree 2 → ŷ₂ = 0.68
        Tree 3 → ŷ₃ = 0.81
          ⋮
        Tree M → ŷₘ = 0.75

        Regression:     ŷ = (1/M) Σₘ ŷₘ  =  average
        Classification: ŷ = mode{ class₁, class₂, ..., classₘ }  =  majority vote

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =======================================================================================# 

### Out-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation:

For each training example xᵢ, roughly 36.8% of trees were trained without it.
These OOB trees form a natural validation set for xᵢ. Averaging predictions
from OOB trees over all training points gives the OOB score — a nearly unbiased
estimate of test error, without holding out a separate validation set.

    OOB Score ≈ Cross-validation score, but free — no extra computation needed.

---

### Part 3: Random Forests — Bagging with Feature Randomness

Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) extend Bagging by introducing a second source
of randomness: at each split in each tree, only a random subset of features
is considered as split candidates.

    Standard decision tree: split on the BEST feature among ALL p features
    Random Forest tree:     split on the BEST feature among RANDOM √p features

This feature randomness decorrelates the trees. Two trees that would both have
split on the same dominant feature (say, "income") are now forced to explore
different features at different splits. The resulting trees are more diverse,
which reduces the ρ in the variance formula and improves ensemble generalisation.

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 3 — Feature Randomness in Random Forests:**

    ALL FEATURES: [f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄, f₅, f₆, f₇, f₈]

    Node in Tree 1, Split 1: randomly select [f₂, f₅, f₇]  → split on f₅
    Node in Tree 1, Split 2: randomly select [f₁, f₃, f₈]  → split on f₁
    Node in Tree 2, Split 1: randomly select [f₄, f₆, f₇]  → split on f₇
          ⋮

    WITHOUT feature randomness: every tree would likely split on f₃ first
    (the most informative feature). Trees would be highly correlated → ρ ≈ 1
    → averaging does very little. This is why simple Bagging of deep trees
    is less effective than Random Forest.

    WITH feature randomness: different trees explore different feature subsets,
    capturing different aspects of the data. Lower ρ → better ensemble.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Hyperparameter    Default           Effect
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    max_features      √p (classif.)     lower = more diversity, weaker trees
                      p/3 (regress.)    higher = stronger trees, more correlation
    n_estimators      100               more = lower variance, diminishing returns
    max_depth         None (full)       limit = more bias, less variance per tree
    min_samples_leaf  1                 higher = smoother, more regularised
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =======================================================================================# 

### Feature Importance in Random Forests:

Random Forests naturally produce feature importance scores — a by-product of
the ensemble construction, not a post-hoc analysis:

    Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI):
        For each feature fⱼ, sum the total impurity decrease (Gini or MSE)
        across all splits on fⱼ, weighted by the number of samples reaching
        that node, averaged over all trees.

    Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA / Permutation Importance):
        For each feature fⱼ, randomly shuffle its values in the OOB set.
        Record the drop in OOB accuracy. Larger drop = more important feature.

    MDA is more reliable than MDI for high-cardinality or correlated features,
    because MDI can be biased toward features with many possible split values.

---

### Part 4: Boosting — Sequential Error Correction

Boosting builds an ensemble SEQUENTIALLY: each new base learner focuses on
the examples that previous learners got wrong. The final prediction is a
weighted vote, with more accurate learners getting higher weights.

The intuition: imagine a student who takes a test, reviews their mistakes,
then takes the test again focusing on weak areas. Each attempt corrects the
systematic errors of the last.

### AdaBoost — Adaptive Boosting (Freund & Schapire, 1997):

AdaBoost maintains a weight distribution over training examples. Initially
all weights are equal (1/n). At each round m:

    1. Train a weak learner hₘ on the weighted training set
    2. Compute weighted error: εₘ = Σᵢ wᵢ · 1[hₘ(xᵢ) ≠ yᵢ]
    3. Compute learner weight: αₘ = (1/2) log((1 − εₘ) / εₘ)
    4. Update sample weights:
           wᵢ ← wᵢ · exp(−αₘ · yᵢ · hₘ(xᵢ))
       then normalise so Σᵢ wᵢ = 1

    Correctly classified:   wᵢ decreases  (model already handles them)
    Misclassified:          wᵢ increases  (next model must focus here)

    Final prediction: F(x) = sign( Σₘ αₘ · hₘ(x) )

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — AdaBoost Weight Evolution:**

    Round 0: All weights equal
    ●●●●●●●●●●●●●○○○○○○○○  (● class+1, ○ class-1, size = weight)

    Round 1: h₁ misclassifies 3 ○ points
    ●●●●●●●●●●●●●○○○○○○○○  → increase weight on 3 misclassified ○
    ●●●●●●●●●●●●●○○○○⊙⊙⊙  (⊙ = upweighted point)

    Round 2: h₂ focuses on the upweighted points, now misclassifies different ones
    ...weights shift again to the NEW hard examples

    Round M: final ensemble αₘ = large for accurate hₘ, small for weak hₘ

    εₘ → 0:  hₘ is nearly perfect → αₘ → ∞ (dominates the vote)
    εₘ = 0.5: hₘ is random → αₘ = 0  (ignored entirely)
    εₘ > 0.5: hₘ is worse than random → αₘ < 0 (reversed!)
    # =======================================================================================# 

### AdaBoost as Exponential Loss Minimisation:

AdaBoost minimises the exponential loss:

    L(y, F(x)) = exp(−y · F(x))    where y ∈ {−1, +1}

The stage-wise algorithm (fit hₘ, compute αₘ, update weights) is exactly
coordinate descent on the exponential loss in function space. This connection,
established by Friedman et al. (2000), placed AdaBoost in the ERM framework
and revealed why it works.

The exponential loss strongly penalises confident wrong predictions:
    y·F(x) = −3  (very wrong): loss = e³ ≈ 20
    y·F(x) = −1  (wrong):      loss = e¹ ≈ 2.7
    y·F(x) = +1  (correct):    loss = e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37

This heavy tail means AdaBoost is sensitive to outliers and mislabelled data.

---

### Part 5: Gradient Boosting — Gradient Descent in Function Space

Gradient Boosting (Friedman, 2001) is the most powerful and general boosting
framework. Instead of deriving a specific weight-update rule for a specific
loss (as AdaBoost does for exponential loss), Gradient Boosting:

    1. Computes the NEGATIVE GRADIENT of any differentiable loss L(yᵢ, F(xᵢ))
       with respect to the current prediction F(xᵢ)

    2. Fits a new base learner hₘ to those negative gradients (pseudo-residuals)

    3. Adds the new learner with a small step size (learning rate η):
                F(x) ← F(x) + η · γₘ · hₘ(x)

The pseudo-residuals rᵢₘ = −∂L/∂F(xᵢ) tell us the direction each prediction
should move to decrease the loss. Fitting a tree to them finds the structure in
the data that predicts which way to nudge each observation.

For MSE loss (regression), the pseudo-residuals are just the residuals:
    L = (1/2)(y − F)²   →   −∂L/∂F = y − F(x)

This is why Gradient Boosting with MSE loss is literally "fit a tree to the
residuals of the current model", repeated many times.

For log-loss (classification):
    L = −y·log(p) − (1−y)·log(1−p)   →   pseudo-residuals = y − p(x)

The algorithm is identical; only the residuals change.

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 5 — Gradient Boosting Stage by Stage:**

    TARGET:  y
    INITIAL: F₀(x) = mean(y)   (constant prediction)

    Residuals₁ = y − F₀(x)
    Fit Tree₁ to residuals₁  →  h₁(x)
    F₁(x) = F₀(x) + η · h₁(x)

    Residuals₂ = y − F₁(x)   (smaller now — F₁ corrected some errors)
    Fit Tree₂ to residuals₂  →  h₂(x)
    F₂(x) = F₁(x) + η · h₂(x)

         ⋮

    Residualsₘ = y − Fₘ₋₁(x)
    Fit Treeₘ to Residualsₘ   →  hₘ(x)
    Fₘ(x) = Fₘ₋₁(x) + η · hₘ(x)

    As M → ∞ and η → 0: Fₘ → perfect fit to training data (overfitting!)
    Solution: early stopping, small η, or explicit regularisation (XGBoost)

    KEY: Each tree is SHALLOW (max_depth=1,2,3) — not a forest of deep trees.
    Depth controls the interaction order: depth-1 trees = no interactions,
    depth-2 trees = pairwise interactions, etc.

### Part 6: Stacking — Learning to Combine

Stacking (Wolpert, 1992) trains a meta-learner (level-1 model) to optimally
combine the predictions of base learners (level-0 models).

The critical insight: base learner predictions on training data will be
overfit (the learner has "seen" those examples). To get honest predictions
for the meta-learner to train on, use k-fold cross-validation:

    1. Split training data into k folds
    2. For each fold i:
           Train all base learners on folds ≠ i
           Predict on fold i → out-of-fold predictions
    3. Stack out-of-fold predictions as new features → Z_train
    4. Retrain all base learners on FULL training data
    5. Train meta-learner on Z_train (with y as target)
    6. At test time: base learners predict → meta-learner combines

### From Ensembles to Deep Learning:

The same ideas that power ensemble methods appear throughout deep learning:

    Dropout:          approximate ensemble of 2^p neural networks
    Multi-head attention: ensemble of independent attention patterns
    Model averaging:  classic ensembling of neural network checkpoints
    Mixture of Experts (MoE): gated ensemble — each expert handles a region

Gradient Boosting and neural networks are converging: XGBoost now uses
GPU acceleration and neural-style regularisation, while TabNet and NODE
implement differentiable tree-like operations in neural architectures.

For tabular data (the bread-and-butter of industry ML), Gradient Boosting
still outperforms deep learning on most benchmarks as of 2024 — one of the
few areas where classical ML holds its ground.

  The meta-learner has learned to weight base models by their reliability.
  Negative weights can occur when a base model's probability estimates are
  poorly calibrated (it may be overconfident in the wrong direction).

  KEY STACKING TIPS:
    1. Use OOF predictions — always. Direct predictions on training data leak.
    2. Add original features to meta-learner inputs (passthrough=True) for
       cases where base models disagree and original features resolve ambiguity.
    3. Keep the meta-learner SIMPLE (Logistic Regression, Ridge).
       A complex meta-learner will overfit the OOF predictions.
    4. Stacking gains most when base learners are DIVERSE (different algorithms,
       different feature subsets, different hyperparameter regimes).

  1. Single tree has high variance — test accuracy much lower than train
  2. Random Forest reduces variance via bagging + feature randomness
  3. AdaBoost reduces bias by sequential error correction (watch overfitting with noisy data)
  4. Gradient Boosting = most powerful tabular method, needs careful tuning
  5. Bagging: parallel, robust, good baseline. Boosting: sequential, best accuracy
  6. Feature importance is free from all tree ensembles (MDI or permutation)
  7. OOB score ≈ cross-validation score — use it for free validation
  8. Learning rate × n_estimators are coupled: small lr + many trees wins
  9. Stacking adds modest gains at significant complexity cost
  10. For tabular data: GBM (XGBoost/LightGBM) still beats deep learning (2024)
