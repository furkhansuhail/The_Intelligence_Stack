Neural Networks — Universal Approximators
==========================================

A neural network is a computational graph of simple parameterised functions,
chained together to form a highly flexible, learnable mapping from inputs to
outputs. Each layer transforms its input into a new representation, and across
many layers the network learns to represent increasingly abstract features of
the data — edges, then shapes, then objects; or characters, then words, then
grammar; or raw measurements, then interactions, then decisions.

Neural networks are not magic. They are composed of nothing more than matrix
multiplications and elementwise nonlinearities, trained by gradient descent
via the chain rule. What makes them powerful is the combination of:
    (1) sufficient depth to represent complex functions
    (2) sufficient data to guide gradient descent toward useful solutions
    (3) effective regularisation to prevent memorisation
    (4) efficient hardware to make the computation tractable

They are the bridge from the classical algorithms in this series to the deep
learning models — CNNs, Transformers, LLMs — that power modern AI.

### What is a Neural Network?

A feedforward neural network is a function F: ℝᵖ → ℝᵏ built by composing
L layers, each of the form:

                    aˡ = σ( Wˡ aˡ⁻¹ + bˡ )

Where:
    aˡ⁻¹:   input to layer l  (the previous layer's output, or the raw features)
    Wˡ:     weight matrix of layer l  (learned during training)
    bˡ:     bias vector of layer l   (learned during training)
    σ(·):   activation function     (applied elementwise, introduces nonlinearity)
    aˡ:     output of layer l (the "activations" — also called hidden representations)

The full network computes:
    F(x) = σ_L( W_L · σ_{L-1}( W_{L-1} · ... σ_1( W_1 · x + b_1 ) ... + b_{L-1} ) + b_L )

This is just repeated matrix multiplication and function application.
The power comes from what the network learns to represent in each layer.

    Things that exist inside the model (learned during training):
        - All weight matrices W¹, W², ..., W_L
        - All bias vectors b¹, b², ..., b_L
        - For a depth-3 network with widths [p, 64, 32, k]:
          Total parameters = p×64 + 64 + 64×32 + 32 + 32×k + k

    Things you control before training (hyperparameters):
        - Number of layers (depth)
        - Number of neurons per layer (width)
        - Activation function (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, GELU...)
        - Loss function (MSE, cross-entropy...)
        - Optimiser (SGD, Adam, AdamW...)
        - Learning rate and schedule
        - Batch size
        - Regularisation (dropout rate, L2 weight decay)


### Are Neurons Like Logic Gates? The Historical Origin

Yes — and this is exactly where neural networks came from.

In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts showed that a single neuron modelled as a binary
threshold function — outputting 1 if the weighted sum of inputs exceeds a
threshold, 0 otherwise — is equivalent to a logic gate:

    AND gate:  fire if ALL inputs are active    (high threshold, all weights = 1)
    OR gate:   fire if ANY input is active      (low threshold, all weights = 1)
    NOT gate:  fire if input is INACTIVE        (negative weight, threshold = -0.5)

A network of such neurons can compute ANY Boolean function — it is Turing complete.

    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Historical Neuron Types — Binary to Continuous:**

    McCulloch-Pitts (1943): binary threshold
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    output = 1  if  Σ wᵢ xᵢ ≥ θ
             0  otherwise

    This IS a logic gate. The limitation: binary, not differentiable.
    You cannot compute gradients through a step function → cannot use
    gradient descent to learn the weights.

    Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958): same binary output, learnable weights
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    output = sign( Σ wᵢ xᵢ + b )
    Update rule: w ← w + α (y - ŷ) x  (error-driven, not gradient-based)

    Modern neuron: continuous activation function (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    output = σ( Σ wᵢ xᵢ + b )    where σ is smooth and differentiable

    The move from binary thresholds to continuous activations is what
    enabled backpropagation (1986) and made modern deep learning possible.

    MODERN NETWORKS:    not binary logic gates
    BIOLOGICAL NEURONS: not mathematical models
    MATHEMATICAL NEURONS: differentiable parameterised functions
    The analogy to biology is loose — the maths is the reality.

### The Universal Approximation Theorem

**Theorem (Cybenko 1989, Hornik 1991):** A feedforward network with a single
hidden layer containing a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any
continuous function on a compact subset of ℝᵖ to arbitrary precision.

    ANY function → ONE hidden layer → enough neurons → approximated

This is profoundly powerful. It means the hypothesis class of neural networks
is "everything" — given enough neurons, there is always a network that fits.

**The catch:** the theorem guarantees existence, not learnability.
A network wide enough to approximate any function might:
    - Require exponentially many neurons in the shallow case
    - Not be findable by gradient descent in reasonable time
    - Overfit the training data badly

Deep networks (many layers) are more efficient: they can represent exponentially
more functions than shallow networks with the same number of parameters, because
each layer builds on the compressed representations of the previous layer.

### Part 1: The Forward Pass — How a Network Computes


### Layer-by-Layer Computation:

Start with raw input x (shape: p).
Apply each layer in sequence to produce the final output ŷ.

    INPUT  x:    shape (p,)           ← raw features
    LAYER 1:     z¹ = W¹x + b¹        ← linear (matrix multiply + bias)
                 a¹ = σ(z¹)           ← activation (nonlinearity)
    LAYER 2:     z² = W²a¹ + b²       ← linear again
                 a² = σ(z²)           ← activation again
    ...
    OUTPUT:      ŷ = W_L a_{L-1} + b_L  ← final linear layer
                 (+ softmax for multiclass, or sigmoid for binary)


### Why Nonlinear Activations Are Essential:

Without activations: σ(x) = x (identity)
    Layer 2 output: W²(W¹x + b¹) + b² = (W²W¹)x + (W²b¹ + b²) = W'x + b'
    → A deep linear network is exactly equivalent to a single linear layer
    → Can only represent linear functions regardless of depth

With nonlinear activations:
    Each layer can represent complex, nonlinear transformations
    Composing nonlinear layers creates exponentially richer function classes


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 1 — Forward Pass Through a 3-Layer Network:**

    Input: x = [x₁, x₂]   (2 features)

    Layer 1 (hidden, 3 neurons):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    z¹₁ = w¹₁₁x₁ + w¹₁₂x₂ + b¹₁    a¹₁ = ReLU(z¹₁)
    z¹₂ = w¹₂₁x₁ + w¹₂₂x₂ + b¹₂    a¹₂ = ReLU(z¹₂)
    z¹₃ = w¹₃₁x₁ + w¹₃₂x₂ + b¹₃    a¹₃ = ReLU(z¹₃)

    Layer 2 (hidden, 2 neurons):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    z²₁ = w²₁₁a¹₁ + w²₁₂a¹₂ + w²₁₃a¹₃ + b²₁    a²₁ = ReLU(z²₁)
    z²₂ = w²₂₁a¹₁ + w²₂₂a¹₂ + w²₂₃a¹₃ + b²₂    a²₂ = ReLU(z²₂)

    Output (1 neuron, binary classification):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ŷ = σ( w³₁a²₁ + w³₂a²₂ + b³ )   ← sigmoid → probability in [0,1]

    ALL OF THIS is just matrix multiplications and elementwise functions.
    In matrix form:  a¹ = ReLU(W¹x + b¹),  a² = ReLU(W²a¹ + b²),  ŷ = σ(W³a² + b³)
    # =======================================================================================# 


### What Do the Hidden Layers Learn?

Each layer learns a transformation of the previous layer's representation.
For a network trained on images:
    Layer 1: detects edges (oriented lines at different angles)
    Layer 2: combines edges into shapes (corners, curves, textures)
    Layer 3: combines shapes into parts (eyes, wheels, branches)
    Layer 4: combines parts into objects (faces, cars, trees)

For a network trained on tabular data:
    Layer 1: detects individual feature thresholds and combinations
    Layer 2: detects interactions between features
    Layer 3: detects patterns in those interactions
    Final:   produces the prediction

The weights Wˡ are not hand-designed — they are learned from data to minimise
the loss. The network discovers which combinations of inputs are useful,
not us.

### Part 2: Activation Functions


### Sigmoid:   σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e⁻ᶻ)

    Output range: (0, 1)  — good for binary probability outputs
    Gradient:     σ'(z) = σ(z)(1−σ(z))  — maximum 0.25 at z=0
    Problems:     VANISHING GRADIENT — for large |z|, gradient ≈ 0
                  Gradients are multiplied across layers; near-zero gradients
                  make early layers learn extremely slowly (or not at all).
                  Also not zero-centred → slow convergence.
    Use now:      output layer only (binary classification)


### Tanh:      tanh(z) = (e^z − e^{-z}) / (e^z + e^{-z})

    Output range: (−1, 1)  — zero-centred (better than sigmoid)
    Gradient:     tanh'(z) = 1 − tanh²(z)  — maximum 1.0 at z=0
    Problems:     Still saturates for large |z|, still vanishing gradient
    Use now:      RNNs / LSTMs, some output layers


### ReLU:      ReLU(z) = max(0, z)

    Output range: [0, ∞)
    Gradient:     1 if z > 0,   0 if z ≤ 0   (a step function)
    Advantages:   No saturation for positive z → gradients flow freely
                  Computationally trivial (max operation)
                  Biologically plausible (sparse activation)
    Problems:     DYING ReLU — if z < 0 for all training examples, the
                  neuron always outputs 0, gradient is always 0 → never learns.
                  Not differentiable at z=0 (in practice, use subgradient).
    Use now:      Default for most hidden layers in feedforward networks


### Leaky ReLU:    f(z) = max(αz, z)  where α ≈ 0.01

    Gradient:     1 if z > 0,   α if z ≤ 0
    Fix:          dying ReLU — negative inputs still get a small gradient
    Use when:     Dying ReLU is a problem (large networks, small batch size)


### GELU:      Gaussian Error Linear Unit — approximate: z · σ(1.702z)

    Properties:   Smooth everywhere, approximately like ReLU for large z,
                  decays smoothly to 0 for large negative z.
    Advantage:    Works better than ReLU in Transformers and large models.
    Use now:      Default in BERT, GPT, most modern Transformer models.

    Sigmoid:      0.047   0.269   0.500   0.731   0.953
    Tanh:        -0.995  -0.762   0.000   0.762   0.995

    GELU:        -0.004  -0.159   0.000   0.841   2.996
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Sigmoid, Tanh: saturate at extremes → vanishing gradient
    ReLU:          zero for negative inputs → dying ReLU
    GELU:          smooth, no saturation for positive, smooth decay for negative

### Part 3: The Loss Function and What We're Optimising


### Choosing the Right Loss:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Task                Output activation    Loss function
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Binary classif.     Sigmoid (output)     Binary cross-entropy BCE
    Multiclass          Softmax (output)     Categorical cross-entropy CE
    Regression          Linear (no activ.)   MSE or MAE or Huber
    Multilabel          Sigmoid per output   BCE per output (summed)
    Ranking             Sigmoid / linear     Pairwise / listwise ranking loss
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Cross-Entropy Loss (Classification):

For binary classification with label y ∈ {0,1} and predicted probability ŷ:
    BCE(y, ŷ) = −[y · log(ŷ) + (1−y) · log(1−ŷ)]

For K-class classification with one-hot label yᵢ ∈ {0,1}^K and softmax output:
    CE(y, ŷ) = −Σₖ yₖ · log(ŷₖ)

These losses are maximally penalised when the model is confident and wrong
(predicts 0.99 for the wrong class), and minimally penalised when correct.
They are differentiable everywhere needed and connect to maximum likelihood
estimation (minimising CE = maximising log-likelihood under the model).


---


### Part 4: Backpropagation — How Weights Are Changed


### The Core Idea — Gradient Descent:

Training minimises the average loss over the training set:
    L(W) = (1/n) Σᵢ loss(yᵢ, F(xᵢ; W))

We update all weights in the direction of steepest descent:
    W ← W − α · ∇_W L

The challenge: how do we compute ∇_W L efficiently when W includes millions
of weights spread across many layers?

Answer: **Backpropagation** — the chain rule applied recursively from the
output layer back to the input layer. It computes all gradients in O(2 × forward pass),
which is remarkably efficient.


### The Chain Rule — The Foundation of Backpropagation:

If f = g(h(x)), then:    df/dx = dg/dh · dh/dx

For a network with two layers:
    z¹ = W¹x + b¹      a¹ = σ(z¹)
    z² = W²a¹ + b²     ŷ = σ(z²)
    L  = loss(y, ŷ)

To compute ∂L/∂W¹ (how the first layer's weights affect the loss):

    ∂L/∂W¹ = ∂L/∂ŷ · ∂ŷ/∂z² · ∂z²/∂a¹ · ∂a¹/∂z¹ · ∂z¹/∂W¹

Each term is easy to compute individually. Backpropagation computes them
efficiently by caching intermediate values during the forward pass.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 3 — Forward Pass → Loss → Backward Pass:**

    FORWARD PASS (left to right):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    x  →  [z¹=W¹x+b¹]  →  [a¹=σ(z¹)]  →  [z²=W²a¹+b²]  →  [ŷ=σ(z²)]  →  L
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Cache: x, z¹, a¹, z², ŷ  (needed for backward pass)

    BACKWARD PASS (right to left, chain rule):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ∂L/∂ŷ              = loss'(y, ŷ)              [easy: BCE derivative]
    ∂L/∂z²             = ∂L/∂ŷ × σ'(z²)           [chain rule through activation]
    ∂L/∂W²             = ∂L/∂z² × (a¹)ᵀ           [chain rule through matrix mult]
    ∂L/∂b²             = ∂L/∂z²                    [gradient of bias]
    ∂L/∂a¹             = (W²)ᵀ × ∂L/∂z²           [propagate gradient back]
    ∂L/∂z¹             = ∂L/∂a¹ × σ'(z¹)          [chain rule through activation]
    ∂L/∂W¹             = ∂L/∂z¹ × xᵀ              [gradient of first layer weights]
    ∂L/∂b¹             = ∂L/∂z¹                    [gradient of first bias]
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ALL gradients computed in one backward pass = one forward pass in cost.

    KEY INSIGHT: Each layer's gradient depends only on the gradient from the
    layer above (the "error signal" flowing backward) and the cached activations.
    # =======================================================================================# 


### The Weight Update Step:

After computing gradients, weights are updated by an optimiser.
Three common choices:

**Vanilla SGD:**
    W ← W − α · ∂L/∂W

**SGD with Momentum:**
    v ← β·v + (1−β)·∂L/∂W        (momentum accumulates gradient history)
    W ← W − α·v
    β = 0.9 is the standard choice. Momentum smooths oscillations and
    accelerates movement in consistent gradient directions.

**Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):**
    m ← β₁·m + (1−β₁)·∂L/∂W      (1st moment = exponential moving average of gradient)
    v ← β₂·v + (1−β₂)·(∂L/∂W)²   (2nd moment = exponential moving average of gradient²)
    m̂ = m/(1−β₁ᵗ),  v̂ = v/(1−β₂ᵗ)  (bias correction for early steps)
    W ← W − α · m̂ / (√v̂ + ε)
    Defaults: β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999, ε=1e-8, α=0.001

    Adam adapts the learning rate per-parameter: parameters with consistently
    large gradients get a smaller effective learning rate; parameters with
    small or noisy gradients get a larger effective rate.


### Why the Loss Surface is Non-Convex:

For linear regression, the loss surface is a bowl — one global minimum.
For neural networks with nonlinear activations, the loss surface has:
    - Many local minima (but often similar loss to the global minimum)
    - Saddle points (gradient = 0 but not a minimum)
    - Flat regions (tiny gradients → slow learning)
    - Sharp vs flat minima (flat minima generalise better — implicit regularisation)

Neural networks are trained in the non-convex regime. We cannot guarantee
finding the global optimum, but in practice SGD/Adam find solutions that
generalise well. The reasons are an active area of research.

### Part 5: The Training Loop — Epochs, Batches, and Iterations


### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):

Computing the gradient over ALL n training examples is expensive: O(n·p) per step.
Instead, at each step we sample a random mini-batch of B examples and compute
the gradient on just those B examples — an unbiased estimate of the true gradient.

    Mini-batch gradient descent (the standard):
        For each epoch:
            Shuffle training data
            For each batch of B examples:
                Compute forward pass on B examples
                Compute average loss over the B examples
                Backpropagate to get gradients
                Update weights with SGD / Adam

    Batch size B:
        B = 1:    pure SGD — noisy, slow per epoch, many updates
        B = n:    full batch GD — exact gradient, slow per update
        B = 32–256: mini-batch SGD — the standard  balance

    Epoch: one complete pass through the entire training set.
    Iteration: one weight update (on one mini-batch).


### Why Noise in SGD Helps:

Noisy gradient estimates from small batches act as regularisation:
    1. Escapes sharp local minima (noisy steps jump out)
    2. Finds flatter minima that generalise better
    3. Acts like data augmentation (different batch = different function estimate)

Large batches compute more accurate gradients but often find sharper minima
that generalise poorly. This is called the "generalization gap" of large batches.

### Part 6: Training, Validation, and Test — The Three Datasets


This is one of the most important concepts in all of machine learning.
Each dataset serves a completely different purpose.

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                             │
    │  TRAINING SET (typically 60–70% of data):                   │
    │    What happens: gradient descent runs on this data.        │
    │    The loss on training data is minimised directly.         │
    │    The model SEES this data and learns from it.             │
    │    Training loss tells you: is the model learning at all?   │
    │                                                             │
    │  VALIDATION SET (typically 10–20% of data):                 │
    │    What happens: no gradient updates. Forward pass only.    │
    │    Used to: select hyperparameters (depth, width, LR,       │
    │    dropout), detect overfitting, choose early-stopping epoch│
    │    The model does NOT see this during training.             │
    │    Validation loss tells you: is the model generalising?    │
    │                                                             │
    │  TEST SET (typically 10–20% of data):                       │
    │    What happens: evaluated ONCE, at the very end.           │
    │    Never used for any decisions during development.         │
    │    Provides an unbiased estimate of real-world performance. │
    │    Test loss tells you: how will it perform in deployment?  │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


### Why You Cannot Use the Test Set for Decisions:

If you use the test set to decide which model to keep, you are performing
implicit optimisation over the test set — you are selecting the model that
happened to perform best on test, which inflates the apparent performance.

The validation set is the "held-out" data you use during development.
The test set is the "locked vault" you open only once.

    Anti-pattern: "I tried 30 models and picked the one with best test accuracy"
    → The test accuracy is now the best of 30 samples from a distribution
    → Expected to be optimistic by several percentage points
    → The real-world performance will be worse

    Correct pattern:
    → Use validation to pick the model
    → Use test ONCE to report the final result


### The Loss Curve — Diagnosing Training:


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 4 — Loss Curves and Their Interpretation:**

    UNDERFITTING (high bias):              HEALTHY TRAINING:
    loss ↑                                 loss ↑
      │ ─────────────── train              │╲ train
      │ ─────────────── val                │  ╲_______________
      │                                    │   ╲ val
      │  both losses high and flat         │    ╲_____________
      └──────────────────→ epoch           └──────────────────→ epoch
    Fix: more capacity, more epochs        val loss converges and stays low

    OVERFITTING (high variance):           EARLY STOPPING:
    loss ↑                                 loss ↑
      │╲ train                             │╲ train
      │  ╲__________                       │  ╲__________
      │             ╲ val (rises!)         │   ╲ val
      │              ╲────                 │    ╲───* stop here
      └──────────────────→ epoch           └──────────────────→ epoch
    Fix: dropout, weight decay, less       Save weights at val minimum
    capacity, more data                    Use those weights for test

    THE GAP between train and val loss:
      Small gap:  good generalisation
      Large gap:  overfitting
    # =======================================================================================# 


### Overfitting — Why It Happens and How to Fix It:

Overfitting = the model fits the training data so well that it memorises
noise specific to the training set, rather than learning the general pattern.
Performance on unseen data is worse than on training data.

Signs of overfitting:
    - Training loss continues falling, validation loss starts rising
    - Training accuracy much higher than validation accuracy
    - Model predicts training examples perfectly but fails on new ones

**Regularisation techniques:**

    Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014):
        During training: randomly zero out each neuron with probability p (typically 0.2–0.5)
        During inference: use all neurons, scale outputs by (1−p)
        Effect: forces the network to learn redundant representations —
                no single neuron can be relied upon, so all neurons must
                contribute meaningfully. Approximates training an ensemble.

    L2 Weight Decay:
        Add λ/2 · ||W||² to the loss.
        Gradient: ∂L/∂W += λ·W  → W ← W · (1−α·λ) − α · ∂L/∂W
        Effect: shrinks all weights toward zero. Large weights are penalised.
        Prevents any single pathway from dominating.

    Batch Normalisation (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015):
        Normalise each mini-batch to zero mean, unit variance, then rescale.
        Effect: reduces internal covariate shift, allows higher learning rates,
                acts as regularisation.

    Early Stopping:
        Monitor validation loss during training. Stop when it stops improving.
        Save the weights at the best validation epoch.
        Simple and highly effective — no additional hyperparameter.

### Part 7: How Patterns Are Found Between Neurons


### What a Weight Actually Represents:

A weight wᵢⱼ between neuron i (in layer l−1) and neuron j (in layer l) encodes
how much neuron i's activation should influence neuron j's input.

    wᵢⱼ > 0:   neuron i EXCITES neuron j (more i → more j)
    wᵢⱼ < 0:   neuron i INHIBITS neuron j (more i → less j)
    wᵢⱼ ≈ 0:   neuron i is irrelevant to neuron j

After training, each neuron in a hidden layer responds to a particular pattern
in the input:
    - A neuron with large positive weights on features [tall, long_neck]
      and large negative weight on [small] → activates for giraffes
    - A neuron with large weight on [curve, dark] → activates for edges
    - A neuron connected to many "urgent", "free", "click" features → spam


### What Gradient Descent Discovers:

Gradient descent does not know in advance that "tall + long neck = giraffe".
It discovers which patterns are useful by observing:
    - When this neuron fired on training examples with label "giraffe",
      the loss was lower than when it didn't fire
    - Therefore: increase the weights connecting the "tall" and "long_neck"
      neurons to this neuron

This is the fundamental learning process:
    1. Make predictions with current weights
    2. Measure how wrong they are (loss)
    3. Backpropagate: for each weight, compute how much changing it would
       reduce the loss (the gradient)
    4. Adjust every weight by a small step in the gradient direction
    5. Repeat millions of times

The patterns emerge because features that correlate with the correct label
receive consistently positive gradient signal — their weights grow.
Features that are irrelevant or misleading receive inconsistent gradient signal
— their weights stay small or shrink.


    # =======================================================================================# 
    **Diagram 5 — How a Neuron Learns to Detect a Pattern:**

    Training example 1: cat (label=1)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Input: [whiskers=1, tail=1, bark=0]
    Neuron output: 0.2 (too low for cat)
    Gradient: increase weights for whiskers and tail → cat signal
              decrease weight for bark (not active, but check sign)

    Training example 2: dog (label=0)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Input: [whiskers=0, tail=1, bark=1]
    Neuron output: 0.6 (too high — neuron fires for dog)
    Gradient: decrease weight for bark → bark should suppress firing
              tail weight: conflicting signal (present in both) → stays small

    After many examples:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    w_whiskers → large positive  (whiskers → probably cat)
    w_bark     → large negative  (bark → probably NOT cat)
    w_tail     → near zero       (tail appears in both — not discriminative)

    The neuron has learned to detect "cat vs dog" patterns
    purely from gradient descent — no one programmed this.
    # =======================================================================================#

### Part 8: What Happens During Testing


### The Testing Phase — No Learning:

When a trained model is evaluated on the test set:
    - All weights are FROZEN (no gradient computation, no weight updates)
    - Only the forward pass runs: x → layer 1 → layer 2 → ... → ŷ
    - The prediction ŷ is compared to the true label y to compute metrics

    model.eval()  in PyTorch  — disables dropout, uses running statistics in BatchNorm
    with torch.no_grad():     — disables gradient computation (saves memory and time)

Testing is just inference: compute the output of the frozen network.


### Dropout During Training vs Testing:

During TRAINING:
    Each neuron is randomly dropped with probability p = 0.5
    Different neurons are dropped each forward pass
    Network cannot rely on any one neuron → learns robust features

During TESTING:
    All neurons are active (no dropout applied)
    But outputs are scaled by (1−p) to keep expected values the same
    This is called "inverted dropout" — the most common implementation

    Inverted dropout (during training):
        mask = (random_uniform(shape) > p)   ← 1 with prob (1-p), 0 with prob p
        output = (input × mask) / (1 − p)   ← scale UP during training
    At test: just use output = input as-is (no masking, no scaling)


### Metrics for Classification vs Regression:

    Classification:   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC, Log-loss
    Regression:       MSE, RMSE, MAE, R², Huber loss
    Calibration:      Brier score, reliability diagram


---


### Part 9: The Architecture — Design Decisions


### Depth vs Width:

    WIDER network:   more neurons per layer → can represent more functions per layer
    DEEPER network:  more layers → can represent compositional functions efficiently

    Deep networks are better at:
        - Learning hierarchical representations
        - Representing exponentially more functions with same parameter count
        - Image recognition, natural language understanding

    Wide networks are better at:
        - Avoiding vanishing gradients (fewer multiplications)
        - Problems with less hierarchical structure
        - When depth causes training instability

### The Depth-Generalisation Relationship:

Deeper networks tend to find solutions with better generalisation properties,
even though they have more parameters. This is the "deep learning puzzle":
    - Classical statistics: more parameters → worse generalisation
    - Deep networks: more depth → often better generalisation

Reasons: weight sharing (CNNs), residual connections, implicit regularisation
from SGD, and the hierarchical nature of real-world data.


### Architecture Evolution:

    Fully Connected (MLP / Dense):   all-to-all connections
                                     Good for tabular data
    Convolutional (CNN):              weight sharing over spatial locations
                                     Good for images
    Recurrent (RNN/LSTM/GRU):         sequential processing with state
                                     Good for sequences, time series
    Transformer:                      self-attention, no sequential constraint
                                     Current state-of-the-art for text, images
    Graph Neural Network (GNN):       message passing on graph topology
                                     Good for molecules, social networks

### Part 10: Where Neural Networks Sit in the Series


    Perceptron → Logistic Regression → SVM → Decision Tree
         → Random Forest → Gradient Boosting → KNN → Naive Bayes → Neural Networks

    All previous models: fixed, manually designed feature space
                         Learning only adjusts the final combination
    Neural Networks:     learns the feature REPRESENTATION itself
                         Each layer transforms the feature space

    This is the crucial shift: representation learning.

    The models above this layer in modern AI:
        CNNs:         spatial representation learning (images)
        LSTMs:        sequential representation learning (text, audio)
        Transformers: contextual representation learning (text, images, code)
        LLMs:         world knowledge representation (GPT, Claude, Gemini)

  Key concepts demonstrated:
    • Neuron: z = W·x + b,  a = σ(z)   — linear transform + nonlinearity
    • Neurons ARE historically logic gates — McCulloch-Pitts (1943) were
      binary threshold units. Modern neurons use smooth activations.
    • Smooth activations (ReLU, GELU) enable backpropagation
    • Forward pass: compute predictions layer by layer
    • Loss function: measures how wrong the predictions are
    • Backpropagation: chain rule propagates gradients back through layers
    • Weight update: W ← W − α·∂L/∂W  (gradient descent)
    • Patterns found: weights grow for features that correlate with correct labels
    • Training/Validation/Test: three distinct purposes
    • Overfitting: memorises training data; fix with dropout, L2, early stopping

  1.  A neuron = σ(Σ wᵢ xᵢ + b) — weighted sum + nonlinearity
  2.  YES — neurons were originally binary logic gates (McCulloch-Pitts 1943)
      Modern neurons use smooth activations for differentiability
  3.  Without nonlinear activations, any depth = one linear layer
  4.  Forward pass: input → layer 1 → layer 2 → ... → prediction
  5.  Loss: measures error between prediction and ground truth
  6.  Backprop: chain rule computes ∂L/∂W for every weight simultaneously
  7.  Weight update: W ← W − α · ∂L/∂W  (gradient descent step)
  8.  Adam adapts learning rate per-parameter (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999)
  9.  Patterns emerge: weights strengthen for features that predict the label
  10. Training set: gradient descent runs here (model sees this data)
  11. Validation set: monitor generalisation, pick hyperparameters, early stop
  12. Test set: evaluated ONCE at the very end — never used for decisions
  13. Overfitting: train loss falls, val loss rises → fix with regularisation
  14. Dropout: randomly zero neurons during training → forces redundancy
  15. ReLU replaced sigmoid in hidden layers — vanishing gradient is solved
  16. Universal Approximation Theorem: any function can be approximated
  17. Deep > wide: compositional representations, efficient parameter use
  18. NNs dominate on images/text/audio; GBM often wins on tabular data
