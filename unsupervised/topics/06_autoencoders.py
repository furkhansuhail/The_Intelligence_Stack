## 06 · Autoencoders

### The Core Idea

An autoencoder is a neural network trained to do something that sounds trivial:
**reproduce its own input as its output**.

    Input x  →  [Encoder]  →  z  →  [Decoder]  →  x̂  ≈  x

If the network had no constraints, the trivial solution would be to copy the
input directly — an identity mapping. The constraint that makes autoencoders
useful is the **bottleneck**: the hidden representation z (the latent code)
must be much smaller than the input x.

Forcing all information through this narrow channel makes the network learn
a compressed representation that captures the essential structure of the data.
The encoder learns to extract the most important features; the decoder learns
to reconstruct the input from those features alone.

This is unsupervised learning — no labels needed. The input itself serves as
its own target.

---

### Architecture

A standard autoencoder has three parts:

**Encoder** — maps input x (dimension p) to latent code z (dimension d, d << p):

    z = f_enc(x) = activation(W_enc · x + b_enc)

In a deep encoder, this is a stack of layers that progressively compress:

    x (p) → h₁ (p/2) → h₂ (p/4) → z (d)

**Bottleneck (Latent Space)** — the compressed representation z. Its
dimensionality d is the key hyperparameter. Too large: trivial copying.
Too small: the network cannot reconstruct the input accurately. Typically
d is chosen as 2–10% of the input dimension, or tuned by reconstruction error.

**Decoder** — maps latent code z back to reconstructed input x̂:

    x̂ = f_dec(z) = activation(W_dec · z + b_dec)

Mirror architecture to the encoder:

    z (d) → h₁ (p/4) → h₂ (p/2) → x̂ (p)

The full autoencoder:

    x̂ = f_dec(f_enc(x))

---

### Training Objective

The autoencoder minimises **reconstruction loss** — the difference between
the input and its reconstruction:

**Mean Squared Error (for continuous inputs):**

    L = (1/n) · Σᵢ ||xᵢ − x̂ᵢ||² = (1/n) · Σᵢ Σⱼ (xᵢⱼ − x̂ᵢⱼ)²

**Binary Cross-Entropy (for binary inputs, e.g. pixel intensities in [0,1]):**

    L = −(1/n) · Σᵢ Σⱼ [xᵢⱼ · log(x̂ᵢⱼ) + (1−xᵢⱼ) · log(1−x̂ᵢⱼ)]

Trained with standard backpropagation and gradient descent. The encoder and
decoder weights are optimised jointly — the gradient flows from the output
loss all the way back through the decoder, through the bottleneck, through
the encoder to the input layer.

### A Worked Example (Tiny Autoencoder, 4D → 2D → 4D)

Architecture: Linear(4→2) → ReLU → Linear(2→4)

Data point: x = [1.0, 0.5, 0.8, 0.2]

**Forward pass:**

Encoder weights W_enc (2×4), biases b_enc (2):
    W_enc = [[0.4, -0.2,  0.7,  0.1],
             [-0.3, 0.8, -0.1,  0.5]]
    b_enc = [0.1, -0.1]

Pre-activation h:
    h[0] = 0.4(1.0) + (−0.2)(0.5) + 0.7(0.8) + 0.1(0.2) + 0.1
         = 0.4 − 0.1 + 0.56 + 0.02 + 0.1 = 0.98
    h[1] = (−0.3)(1.0) + 0.8(0.5) + (−0.1)(0.8) + 0.5(0.2) − 0.1
         = −0.3 + 0.4 − 0.08 + 0.1 − 0.1 = 0.02

Latent code z = ReLU(h) = [max(0, 0.98), max(0, 0.02)] = [0.98, 0.02]

Decoder weights W_dec (4×2), biases b_dec (4):
    W_dec = [[ 0.6,  0.3],
             [ 0.2,  0.7],
             [ 0.8, -0.1],
             [-0.1,  0.4]]
    b_dec = [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0]

Reconstruction x̂:
    x̂[0] = 0.6(0.98) + 0.3(0.02) + 0.0 = 0.588 + 0.006 = 0.594
    x̂[1] = 0.2(0.98) + 0.7(0.02) + 0.1 = 0.196 + 0.014 + 0.1 = 0.310
    x̂[2] = 0.8(0.98) − 0.1(0.02) + 0.0 = 0.784 − 0.002 = 0.782
    x̂[3] = −0.1(0.98) + 0.4(0.02) + 0.0 = −0.098 + 0.008 = −0.090

**Reconstruction loss (MSE):**
    L = [(1.0−0.594)² + (0.5−0.310)² + (0.8−0.782)² + (0.2−(−0.090))²] / 4
      = [0.165 + 0.036 + 0.000 + 0.084] / 4
      = 0.285 / 4 = 0.071

Backpropagation adjusts all weights to reduce this loss. After many iterations
on many data points, the encoder learns a meaningful 2D compression of the data.

### Variants of Autoencoders

#### Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)

The standard autoencoder can overfit by learning a near-identity mapping even
with a small bottleneck (by memorising training examples). The denoising
autoencoder prevents this by **corrupting the input** and training the network
to reconstruct the original clean version:

    x̃ = x + ε    where ε ~ N(0, σ²)   (Gaussian noise)
    or:  x̃ = x ⊙ mask                  (randomly zero out features)

    Minimise: L = ||x − f_dec(f_enc(x̃))||²

By learning to remove noise, the network is forced to learn the underlying
data manifold rather than memorising individual points. The denoising objective
also gives the autoencoder a probabilistic interpretation: it is learning to
map noisy observations back to the clean data manifold.

---

#### Sparse Autoencoder

Rather than constraining the bottleneck size, a sparse autoencoder encourages
most latent neurons to be inactive (near zero) for any given input. This is
enforced by adding a sparsity penalty to the loss:

    L = ||x − x̂||² + β · Σⱼ KL(ρ || ρ̂ⱼ)

where:
- ρ is the target sparsity (e.g. 0.05 — each neuron should activate only 5% of the time)
- ρ̂ⱼ = (1/n) Σᵢ hⱼ(xᵢ) is the average activation of neuron j over the training set
- KL(ρ || ρ̂) = ρ·log(ρ/ρ̂) + (1−ρ)·log((1−ρ)/(1−ρ̂)) is the KL divergence penalty

Sparse autoencoders tend to learn **interpretable features** — each latent
neuron activates for a specific, recognisable pattern in the input. Used
extensively in neuroscience-inspired AI research and mechanistic interpretability.

---

#### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

The VAE is the most important variant. Instead of encoding x to a single
point z in latent space, the VAE encodes x to a **distribution**:

    q(z|x) = N(μ(x), σ²(x))

The encoder outputs two vectors: μ (the mean) and log σ² (the log variance).
The latent code z is sampled from this distribution during training:

    z = μ + σ ⊙ ε    where ε ~ N(0, I)

This **reparameterisation trick** allows gradients to flow through the sampling
operation — the randomness is pushed into ε, which is not a function of the
network parameters.

The VAE training objective is the **ELBO (Evidence Lower BOund)**:

    ELBO = E_q[log p(x|z)]  −  KL(q(z|x) || p(z))
         = Reconstruction term  −  Regularisation term

The first term maximises reconstruction quality (same as standard AE).
The second term is the KL divergence between the learned posterior q(z|x)
and the prior p(z) = N(0, I). It encourages the latent space to be smooth
and continuous — similar inputs should map to nearby distributions.

The minus sign: the total loss minimised = −ELBO = Reconstruction loss + KL term.

**Why the KL term matters:**
Without it, the encoder could map each training point to a tiny region of
latent space, leaving vast empty gaps. With the KL penalty, the encoder must
spread its distributions across the prior, ensuring that random samples from
N(0, I) decode to realistic outputs — enabling **generation**.

---

#### Contractive Autoencoder (CAE)

Adds a penalty on the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the encoder:

    L = ||x − x̂||² + λ · ||∂f_enc(x)/∂x||²_F

This forces the encoder's representation to be insensitive to small
perturbations of the input — making the latent code robust and local
variations are ignored. Used for learning invariant feature representations.

---

### What the Latent Space Learns

A well-trained autoencoder's latent space has structure that reflects the
underlying data manifold:

**Clustering** — Points from the same class cluster together in latent space
even though no class labels were provided. The encoder discovers class structure
through reconstruction pressure alone.

**Interpolation** — Moving smoothly through latent space produces smooth
transitions in the decoded output. This is weak in standard autoencoders
(the latent space may have gaps) but strong in VAEs.

**Disentanglement** — Ideally, each dimension of z corresponds to an independent
factor of variation in the data (shape, colour, orientation, etc.). Standard
autoencoders rarely achieve this without additional constraints, but
Beta-VAE (with a larger KL weight β > 1) encourages disentangled representations.

**Dimensionality** — The intrinsic dimensionality of the learned latent space
often matches the true complexity of the data, independent of the chosen
bottleneck size (though reconstruction quality degrades if the bottleneck is
too small).

### Autoencoders vs PCA

Both compress data into a lower-dimensional representation. The key difference:

| Property                  | PCA                              | Autoencoder                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Compression type          | Linear projection                | Nonlinear mapping                  |
| Reconstruction            | Optimal linear reconstruction    | Can be near-perfect (nonlinear)    |
| Latent space structure    | Orthogonal, ordered by variance  | Arbitrary, learned                 |
| Interpretability          | Components = variance directions | Latent dims may lack clear meaning |
| Training                  | Closed-form (SVD)                | Iterative gradient descent         |
| Scalability               | O(np²) or O(n²p)                 | Scales with batch size             |
| Generation                | Not supported                    | VAE enables generation             |
| Handles nonlinear manifolds| No                               | Yes                                |

### Applications

**Anomaly Detection** — Train on normal data only. At inference, compute
reconstruction error for each sample. Anomalous samples lie far from the
learned manifold → high reconstruction error → flagged as anomalies. Used in
network intrusion detection, fraud detection, medical imaging, manufacturing QC.

**Noise Removal / Image Denoising** — Denoising autoencoders trained on
clean images learn to project noisy inputs back onto the image manifold.

**Dimensionality Reduction for Downstream Tasks** — Use the encoder as a
feature extractor. The latent code z is a dense, semantically meaningful
representation suitable for clustering, classification, or retrieval.

**Data Compression** — The encoder–decoder pair is a learnable lossy
compression codec. Neural image codecs based on autoencoders now outperform
JPEG at low bit rates.

**Generative Modelling (VAE)** — Sample z ~ N(0, I) and decode to generate
new data points. VAEs can interpolate between data points by mixing their
latent codes.

**Representation Learning** — Pretrain an encoder on a large unlabelled
dataset, then fine-tune the encoder (or use its output as features) for a
supervised downstream task with limited labels.

---

### Loss Landscape and Training Tips

**Vanishing gradients** — Deep autoencoders suffer from vanishing gradients
(the gradient is multiplied by weights at each layer on the way back). Use
ReLU or LeakyReLU activations, batch normalisation, and residual connections.

**Posterior collapse (VAE)** — The KL term can push the encoder to ignore z
entirely (posterior = prior, all information carried by the prior mean).
Solutions: KL annealing (gradually increase the KL weight from 0 to 1 during
training), free bits (allow a minimum KL before penalising).

**Mode collapse** — The decoder learns only a few outputs regardless of z.
Address with capacity-controlled architectures and careful learning rate tuning.

**Checkerboard artefacts** — Deconvolution layers can produce grid artefacts.
Use nearest-neighbour upsampling + convolution instead of transposed convolutions.

**Reconstruction blur (VAE)** — VAEs with MSE loss produce blurry reconstructions
because MSE averages over all plausible outputs. Use perceptual loss (feature
matching against a pretrained network) or adversarial training (VAE-GAN) for
sharper results.

### Key Takeaways

1. An autoencoder is an encoder–decoder network trained to reconstruct its
   input through a narrow bottleneck. No labels needed — the input is the target.

2. The bottleneck forces the network to learn a compressed representation z
   that captures the essential structure of the data.

3. The denoising AE prevents overfitting by corrupting inputs; the sparse AE
   adds a sparsity penalty; the VAE encodes to distributions and adds a KL
   regularisation term enabling smooth, generatable latent spaces.

4. The VAE's ELBO = Reconstruction term − KL(posterior || prior). The KL
   term ensures the latent space is smooth and prevents gaps between clusters.

5. Autoencoders are nonlinear — they strictly generalise PCA. They are used
   for anomaly detection, denoising, compression, representation learning,
   and (in the VAE form) generative modelling.
